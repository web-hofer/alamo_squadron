	<h1>Alamo Squadron Constitution and Bylaws</h1>
	
			<p>Current as of September 7th,  2018</p>
	
		<h2>Article I - Designation</h2>
	
			<p>This organization will be formally known as Alamo Squadron.</p>
	
		<h2>Article II - Purpose</h2>
	
			<p>The purpose of Alamo Squadron is the educational advancement of scale modeling skills. The endeavor of the organization shall be to serve the modeling community in Texas, Mexico, and the Southern United States by cultivating and promoting a general interest in the scale modeling hobby by creating a bond of friendship and mentoring through the exchange of information, research and techniques which foster improvement in the individual’s scale modeling skills. Alamo Squadron may raise funds in any manner consistent with a 501(c)7 organization. Alamo Squadron shall be non-sectarian, non-political, and non-profit.</p>
	
		<h2>Article III – Membership</h2>
	
			<h3>Section 1</h3>
	
				<p>Membership in Alamo Squadron is open to all regardless of sex, race, color, ethnic or national origin. Minimum age for membership shall be ten years.  Active membership shall be divided into three categories: Adult, Youth and Life.</p>
			<h3>Section 2</h3>
	
			<ol type="a">
				<li>Those who are 18 years of age or older are eligible for an Adult membership.</li>
				<li>Those between the ages of 10 and 17 years of age, inclusive, are eligible for a Youth membership.</li>  
				<li>Life membership may be conferred upon individuals in accordance to the guidelines as described elsewhere in this document.</li>
			</ol>
	
			<h3>Section 3</h3>
	
			<ol type="a">
				<li>Alamo Squadron will maintain a high standard of ethics and respect for all people.  In the event that a member is observed to have not maintained those standards, two members of the Executive Board will meet privately with the member in question to discuss the situation.  If the member declines this meeting the Executive Board will have met all obligations to have this discussion.  If necessary, the Executive Board may then undertake appropriate disciplinary actions which may include a verbal warning, a written warning, suspension for up to three regularly scheduled membership meetings, or removal from the club.  In general, the principle of escalating discipline will be applied, however this would not apply in every case.</li>
				<li>Suspension of any member of Alamo Squadron for cause can occur by a decision of a majority of the Executive Board.  Such suspensions will be effective immediately and will remain in effect for up to three regularly scheduled membership meetings.  The suspended member will be notified verbally and in writing (email qualifies as “writing”) in advance of the first regularly scheduled membership meeting for which the member has been suspended.  The suspension will be an agenda item at that meeting.  The affected member's voting rights are withdrawn during the suspension period. If the member in question is an Executive Board Officer, that Officer is suspended from participation in any Executive Board action, with that Officer’s duties being temporarily assumed by the remaining Executive Board members.</li>
				<li>Removal of any member of Alamo Squadron from the club, for cause, can occur by recommendation of a majority of the Executive Board and with a confirming vote of the majority of the Adult and Life members present at the regularly scheduled membership meeting at which the removal is an agenda item.  Suspension is not a prerequisite for removal.  Should it be determined that the member in question be removed from the club, the member will be notified in writing (email) that the member’s membership in Alamo Squadron has been terminated.  Pro-rated membership dues will be refunded to the removed member.</li>
