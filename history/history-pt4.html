		<p>By Dick Montgomery, IPMS/USA# 14003</p>
		
		<p>In previous articles the rise and decline of SAMS (San Antonio Modelers Society) was documented. SAMS was dissolved by its remaining members in August, 1974 after having been an impressive club populated by dedicated modelers and knowledgeable leaders. At some point in 1973-1974 the club began to fail meeting the interests and needs of the membership, and the membership failed to rise to the occasion, leaving the club with no clear path forward. Club assets, as prescribed in the SAMS documentation, were distributed to the membership in an equitable fashion. The lights were turned off and the door was closed.</p> 
		
		<p>For the next three years some former SAMS members continued to communicate with one another, with occasional visits with other modelers, and continued to pursue their individual and mutual interests in modeling. In that same time period, IPMS-USA entered its teen-age years and some of the former SAMS members continued to participate in “organized” modeling via their membership in IPMS.</p> 
		
		<p>By 1977 the environment for the establishment of a new modeling club in San Antonio began to develop. A handful of former SAMS members, and other modelers who had come on the scene, outside of the SAMS experience, began to feel that it was the right time to test the waters, to discuss the possibility of organizing a new and different modeling club. The groundwork was laid for a meeting to be held, with the goal of establishing a modeling organization, and on November 11, 1977, those present at this “congress” laid out the basic structure and philosophy of this new organization. </p> 
		
		<p>One of the primary features of this new club was that it would be laid out following the guidelines of IPMS-USA. This decision, above all other decisions about the nature of the club, has never changed. The club was born an IPMS chapter and has continued to enjoy the benefits of IPMS affiliation since that time. No records have been found and archived for these early years of the club, specifically from November of 1977 through 1979, but some information has been found in a publication that was published by some club members and through discussions and interviews with some of those members who remain in San Antonio after all these years (41 years at the time of this writing). </p> 
		
		<p>The first question that most readers would ask is, “When did the club adopt the name, Alamo Squadron?” The answer is, unfortunately, rather vague. The name, “Alamo Squadron” seems to have been adopted by the club between November 1977 and 1979, at which time documentation bears that specific title. Credit for suggesting the title cannot be granted to any specific person as memory fails and documentation (at least at this time) does not exist. However, when pressed, my first reaction would be to credit any of three of the Founders, those persons being Bob Angle, Ros Creed, and Mike Derderian. But again, this is no more than a vague notion that it was one of these three gents. </p> 
		
		<p>Records indicate that there were no officers selected, nor was there a regular meeting site at the time of the initial meeting. Meetings were held at the homes of various members through 1977 and through all or most of 1978. By 1979, the club held regularly scheduled meetings at the Party Room at the London House Apartments. And at some point, in 1978 Roscoe Creed was elected as the President of Alamo Squadron. If memory serves, he became the first President of Alamo Squadron early in 1978 (the club was not formed until November of 1977) and Roscoe remained in that office until August of 1980. No other officers have been identified although I would be surprised to find that there were not others, or at least a Vice-President. In 1981 Tom Ward succeeded Roscoe as the club’s President and remained in that office for one year. Once again, no other officers can be identified in the rather thin collection of publications or paperwork that is currently included in the club archive.</p> 
		
		<h2>Aircraft in Miniature</h2>
		
		<p>A major activity in the club that took place in these first, early years was the publication of “Aircraft in Miniature”, AIM, for short. As with the SAMS publication, AIM was identified, not as an Alamo Squadron publication, but as a stand-alone publication dealing with aviation subjects and history. AIM also served as a place to discuss new modeling techniques, and other "how to" articles. AIM had an impressive staff and from 1978 to 1980 Lee Bracken served as the editor, Bob Angel managed the layout, while Frank Garcia administered production of each edition. It is also obvious from the title of the publication that the central theme and focus of the articles would be on aircraft. In fact, the club, at this time was, more or less, an aircraft club, and even more significantly, rather focused on 1/72nd aircraft. Of course, that focus, as well as the interest of the members in that particular scale could be attributed to the fact that 1/72nd scale aircraft tended to dominate the modeling scene. While there where those who dipped their hands into scales other than 1/72nd, and into subject matter other than aircraft, the club could, at this time, be characterized as a 1/72nd scale Aircraft group.</p> 
		
		<p>A quick look at the contents of a pair of “AIM” publications followed by some excerpts from a club newsletter will provide a sense of the personality of Alamo Squadron in these early years. It is clear from the AIM publications that the “scale of interest” was 1/72nd, and the subject matter of interest was aircraft…and the excerpts from the June, 1981 club newsletter are interesting as well. These excerpts are interesting in that they show that there was an interest in a scheduled, advertised program at the monthly meetings. The Door Prize item and the results of the monthly contest indicate that 1/72nd was the preferred scale and that the subject matter favored aircraft models.</p>

		<p>From the club newsletter, June 21, 1981:</p> 

		<p>"The program: Capt. Frank Emmett says if there's any way possible, he'll have a good Air Force film for us. In June Col. Dennis Smith -- a C-130 pilot in Vietnam -- showed slides he took while on tour there. Good show!"</p> 
	
		<p>"Door prizes: At the June meeting, Lee Bracken won a 1/72 Twin Mustang. Something nice again this time."</p> 

		<p>"Monthly contest: “Well , why not?” June winners: First, Bob Angel, 1/72 FW 190-A; second, Tom Ward, 1/76 Bofors 40 mm AA gun; third, Denny Smith, 1/72 Vought F-8."</p> 
	
		<p>And finally, from the newsletter, there is a preview of an activity that has come to personify Alamo Squadron, that being the hosting of an annual model contest. Here’s that excerpt from the newsletter: “Alamo Squadron Super Contest still doesn't have a home.” This excerpt is clearly an indication that the club, in June of ’81, was entertaining the idea of a large “super” contest, but that is a story for the next article in this “History of Alamo Squadron”.</p>
