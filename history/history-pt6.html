		<p>By Dick Montgomery, IPMS/USA# 14003</p>
		
		 <p>By the end of 1984 Alamo Squadron had reached two goals established by the leadership in previous years. The club fully supported the publication of “Aircraft In Miniature”, and had held 3 successful annual contests, putting ModelFiesta on the map. Officers were serving the club well and members were supporting club activities. Meetings were held on a regular basis, programs on modeling techniques were being presented, and various members volunteered to speak about aircraft or modeling-related topics. Unfortunately, the archive is thin for the period of 1981 through May of 1986. The documentation that exists does, however, offer an interesting view of the club during these years.</p>
		
		<p>By 1986 five different individuals had served as President of Alamo Squadron.  The position of Event Director for ModelFiesta changed hands as well. “Aircraft In Miniature” was identified, not as a stand-alone publication as had been the case earlier in club history but was described as an “Alamo Squadron Magazine”. Unfortunately, the last issue of AIM in the archive is the Volume 6, 1985-1986 issue. It is unknown if AIM continued to be published after this date. Perhaps a reader can clarify this question or, better yet, contact Alamo Squadron and provide any issues of AIM dated 1983, 1984, 1985, and 1986, or later. We will review those who served as officers up to 1985-1986, ModelFiestas 4 & 5, and Alamo Squadron’s first IPMS Region Six convention.</p>
	
		<p>Social organizations such as modeling clubs benefit greatly from leadership who possess the requisite skills. In the early days of Alamo Squadron there is no doubt that such leadership was provided to Alamo Squadron and a number of members were willing to serve as officers and leaders.</p>
		
		<p>From November 1977 to September 1982, Roscoe Creed served as the President of Alamo Squadron. To be clear, the available documentation does not indicate that Creed, or anyone else for that matter, served as the President of the club in its first year, but there are clues in the archives that indicate he was indeed the first President. Documentation for the span from 1978 to September, 1981, shows Roscoe served as the President. The archive does not, however, indicate who held other leadership positions. There is no information regarding the offices of Vice President and Secretary/Treasurer. In September 1981 Tom Ward was elected as the President and served in that office for a single term. In September 1982 to September 1984 Mike Derderian served the two terms in the President, followed by Bob Mills serving as President from August 1984 to September 1985. In 1985, Bob Rodriguez was elected as President. The only other officer identified during the period 1977 to September 1986 is Bob Mills. As mentioned above, Bob served as Vice President in 1983-1984, and then as President during 1984-1985.</p>
		
		<p>“Aircraft In Miniature” had three staff positions. Those positions were Editor, Layout, and Production. From 1978 to 1983 the same three members served on the staff. Lee Bracken was the Editor, Bob Angel managed “layout”, and Frank Garcia managed “production”. In 1984 Phil Friddell became the editor, a position he held until September 1986. Frank Garcia took over “layout” as well as “production. Frank Garcia passed away in Oct 1984. The name may be familiar to those who have attended various ModelFiestas. A memorial award honoring Frank is presented to the Best Navy Aircraft at each event. Ray Rangel volunteered to take over production and also handle computer graphics for AIM. The available documentation shows that Rangel served in these two key positions for September 1984 to September 1985. A table showing officers and AIM staffers over the period of 1978 to 1986 is presented below.</p>

		<p>For ModelFiestas 4 and 5, as well as the IPMS Region 6 Convention, held in the same calendar year as ModelFiesta 5 saw new leadership. Mike Derderian and Bob Rodriguez accepted the responsibilities for leadership roles. Bob Angel served as the Chief Judge, a position that he held for ModelFiestas 1,4,5 and the Regional Convention. Bob most likely served in that role for ModelFiestas 2 and 3 but the documentation for 2 and 3 lists only the Event Director. More detailed documentation and in-depth history of Alamo Squadron's ModelFiesta can be found here: modelfiesta.com/archives</p>
	
		<h2>Aircraft In Miniature</h2>
		
		<p>Aircraft In Miniature was launched with Vol 1, No. 1, published in the spring of 1979. As one can assume from the magazine title, the main focus of AIM was aircraft, not limited to model-centered content, but including history as well. Editor Lee Bracken laid out the overarching goals for AIM in this first issue. Those goals were to provide a historical view of aircraft subjects, provide discussions regarding modeling techniques, and to provide specific information about models via reviews of various kits.</p>
		
	
		<p>We will look at the table of contents of a few issues, just to provide a sample of the excellent content that AIM provided its readers.</p>
	
		<p>This first issue included:</p>
			
		<ul>
			<li>6 kit reviews and a summary of upcoming kit releases by Bob Angel</li>
			<li>A history of the F-89 Scorpion by Lee Bracken</li>
			<li>A history of the SBD Dauntless by Bob Angel</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Jumping forward a year, Vol 2, No. 1 was published in the Spring of 1980:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Survey results (Most wanted kit subjects) is presented by Bob Angel. Not surprising that every kit listed is a model of an aircraft subject in the two primary scales of interest, 1/72nd and 1/48th.</li>
			<li>Latin American Corsairs by Dan Hagedorn</li>
			<li>F-51D Mustang (Not a typo) In Air National Guard by John Dienst</li>
			<li>Modeling the P-51- A Comparison of Available Kits</li>
		</ul>
	
		<p>And finally, a look at the content of the most recent AIM in the archive, that being the Vol 6, 1985-1986 issue. By this time the staff positions had changed hands. Bob Angel served as the Editor, with Mike Derderian as the Assistant Editor. Computer Graphics/Production was handled by Ray Rangel. The Editor’s Comments indicate a name change to “AIM Annual”. Bob Angel went on to state that the death of Frank Garcia in November 1984 was a major setback for AIM. Frank had been in charge of production (printing) of the publication and was able to do it at no cost. After Frank’s passing, no alternative was found so publication ceased.</p>
	
		<ul>
			<li>“The Harry Tate Royal Aircraft Factory RE-8” by Bob Angel</li>
			<li>Kit Reviews by Mike Derderian--- A couple of aircraft kits were reviewed</li>
			<li>“Judy in the Skies” by Bob Angel --- a history of the Japanese Warplane known as the Judy</li>
			<li>“The Convair F-102” by Lee Bracken</li>
			<li>3 View Drawing of the Beechcraft Staggerwing by Don Morgan</li>
		</ul>
	
		<p>With this information about the “Aircraft In Miniature” magazine, that part of the history of Alamo Squadron draws to a close. As mentioned previously, this is the most recent AIM magazine in the archive. It could be that this was the final issue, or it may be that additional AIMs were published, but no copies have been presented for inclusion in the archive. It should be noted that the contributions made by the AIM staff and by those who contributed to AIM show that there were a number of members in Alamo Squadron who made significant contributions to the club through AIM. It should also be obvious that the focus of the club, or at least of those club members who contributed to AIM, was tightly focused on aircraft.</p> 
		
		<h2>The IPMS Region 6 Convention</h2>
	
		<p>Alamo Squadron had been granted the bid to host the Region 6 convention for 1986, and the club chose to host both ModelFiesta V and the Regional Convention in the same year, just four months apart. There was some discussion about whether the club could pull off two major modeling events that close together. In the end, there were no issues that were caused by the proximity of these two events on the calendar, but it also became clear during the Regional that lessons from ModelFiesta V regarding the computer software were not applied.</p>
	
		<p>During the two-day Regional (one of only two events hosted by Alamo Squadron that were multi-day events---both being Regionals) the computer system functioned poorly. The Awards Ceremony was being delayed by the slow process of getting the computer to tally the judging scores, and as soon as a set of results were printed out they were rushed to the Awards Master of Ceremonies, Bob Bethea, so that he could keep the show moving forward. Bob saved the day by telling an unending stream of jokes that kept the audience in a mood more cheerful than one would expect. In the end, the winners were announced, and the show came to its conclusion. The archive has very little information regarding this Regional. No entry total is on record, but a Winner’s List was preserved by Bob Angel and shared with the archive in 2017. The names of some staff members are on file. The Event Director was Mike Derderian with Bob Rodriguez and Ray Rangel given equal billing. Ray Rangel handled the computer technology, and Bob Angel served as the Chief Judge. The archive notes indicate that Mike Derderian also served as the Awards Coordinator. The event was held at what was then known as the Holiday Inn at Loop 410 and I-10 West. The facility is now known as San Antonio Marriott, Northwest. The event was successful, even though the computer system failed to function properly. The event made a small profit, and although there was some criticism regarding the delay in the Awards presentation, comments were helpful and taken as constructive criticism.</p>
		
		<p>By May, 1986 Alamo Squadron had shown that the club and its membership could hold a successful annual event (ModelFiesta). Even though there were a few results that could not be described as “successful”, the first five ModelFiestas, and especially IV and V, established a strong foundation upon which Alamo Squadron was to build ModelFiesta into one of the larger “local” events held in Texas. Thanks to those who travel to ModelFiesta each year, we all (the modeling community in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, other parts of the USA, and Mexico) benefit from an event that is enjoyable and stimulating. And, as a social organization, Alamo Squadron was functioning well, led by members with the leadership skills, supported by members who helped Alamo Squadron continue its positive evolution as a modeling club.</p>
		
		<p>In the next article in this historical series we will continue to track the growth of the club through its newsletters and through the expansion and growth of ModelFiesta.</p>
