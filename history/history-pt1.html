		<p>By Dick Montgomery, IPMS/USA# 14003</p>
		
		<p>This is the first in a series of historical articles about Alamo Squadron. This article reaches back to the San Antonio Modeler’s Society, which was the predecessor to Alamo Squadron. Using issues of the SAMS newsletter, the MODELIST, we seek to get a sense of the members of SAMS, the club’s focus on the hobby, and the conditions of the club as seen by using archived issues of the MODELIST that have been care-fully archived. Thanks to Bob Angel, who provided the hard copies of the MODELIST, to be scanned and archived, and also to Bob for his series of article related to the growth and demise of SAMS.</p> 
	
		<p>Let’s step into the Way-Back Machine and set the date for November, 1969. A modeling club is formalizing its organization and structure and rolls out the inaugural issue of the club newsletter. That modeling club is known as the San Antonio Modeler’s Society (SAMS) and the club publication is labeled as “The Modelist”.</p>
	
		<p>Looking back at some historical events that took place in 1969 one will find such events as: The Beatles' "Abbey Road" album goes #1 in US & stays #1 for 11 weeks, "Bridge over Troubled Water" single is recorded by Simon & Garfunkel, and "Sesame Street" premieres on PBS TV. “Sesame Street” is still going strong, as is Wendy’s. The one significant event for modelers in San Antonio did not make the National List of Important Events: A group of modelers created the “San Antonio Modeler’s Society”, known as SAMS. Documentation of the momentous event exists in the form of Volume 1, Series 1 of “The SAMS Modelist”, a publication produced by members of SAMS. One of the 
		bits of information contained in this inaugural issue is a Membership List. A few of the names on the list might sound familiar.</p>
	
		<h2>The SAMS Directory</h2>
	
		<p>Mark Anderson, Bob Angel, Jr. (Bob, although inactive since 2001, remains a member of Alamo Squadron having received a Life Membership for his outstanding contributions and leadership.), Tommy Brower, Fred Burns, John DeLaGarza, Frank Emmett Jr., Lesley England, Jim Ennis, Sterling Essenmacher, Phil Friddell, Frank Garcia (a Memorial Trophy, presented at a number of ModelFiestas, was named after Frank shortly after his passing. The trophy was awarded to the Best U.S. Navy Jet as determined by the judges), Vance Holiday, James Jasso, Jack Lucas, Fernando Mendoza, Jerry Mohr (Dick Montgomery managed the disposal of Jerry’s "model estate” in 2008, some years after Jerry’s passing), Dick Montgomery (a Life Member, and member with longest record as “active member of Alamo Squadron”), Griffen Murphey, Alfred Overdahl, David Ott, David Reagan, Greg Ripps, Mike Salyers, Dean Shirley, Halbert Stanford, Richard Tait, Myron Tingle, Bill Todd, Danny Waelti, and Leo Ziegler (Bob Angel, with some assistance by Dick Montgomery, managed Leo’s “model estate”).</p>
	
		<h2>SAMS Modelist: Vol 1, Number 1, Nov 1969</h2>
	
		<p>The official title of the club was, “San Antonio Modeler’s Society” and its publication (i.e., newsletter) was officially given the title of, “The SAMS Modelist”. There are only a handful of Modelist publications that have been preserved. Bob Angel was kind enough to loan these documents to the current club leadership, which are now scanned and preserved in digital fashion, and are linked to these pages. The Modelist was printed on legal-sized paper which makes it rather cumbersome to store and scan. The newsletter was mimeographed, and while some issues contain drawings, none contain photographs. For those who are not familiar with the mimeograph process, a paper, roughly similar to paper with a carbon sheet attached, is inserted into a typewriter, with each page being typed manually. Typos were a real pain 
		to correct when using mimeographed forms so typing skills were in high demand. Today, one can view “printing via mimeograph” as not much more technologically advanced than writing on clay tablets with a quill.</p>
	
		<p>The officers of SAMS, in November of 1969 were President Phil Friddell, Vice President Robert (Bob) Angel, and Editor Gregory Ripps. The typing and printing of the Modelist fell to Greg. Greg started this issue of the Modelist with a summary of the contents.</p>
	
		<p>President Phil Friddell provided some introductory comments about the Modelist. Bob Angel’s article on the “Tojo” is featured. In later issues of the club news-letter Bob would continue providing articles about a number of aircraft subjects. Vance Holliday was the SAMS armor expert and Vance’s article in this inaugural issue introduced readers to the various manufacturers which produced armor kits. Editor Greg Ripps provided a basic description of what attendees to the IPMS National Convention might find when they visited Wichita to attend the upcoming convention.</p>
	
		<p>Editor Ripps also included an IPMS/USA Membership Application on the front page which readers could remove from the newsletter and then mail to IPMS to obtain membership. The newsletter contained 4 pages, 1 page being the list of members previously mentioned.</p>
	
		<p>There are some basic “truths” which become evident when studying the newsletter: </p>
			
		<ol>
			<li>It was labor-intensive. Greg had to type the entire contents, setting the typewrite to handle the double column format and margins on the left and right sides of the pages, as well as the top and bottom margins. </li>
			<li>The modeling focus of the club, as a whole, was “aircraft”. Armor was a distant second to Aircraft. </li>
			<li>The club leadership encouraged members to join IPMS/USA, dedicating some space in the Modelist to provide a membership application. Articles about the National Convention can be found in various issued throughout the lifespan of SAMS as well. </li>
			<li>The leadership of the club was very much aware of the importance of a formal structure and organization of the club as seen in the labeling and branding of club and newsletter with specific titles. </li>
		</ol>
	
	
		<p>Thus ended the first “Modelist”. SAMS had set a direction and with the publication of the “Modelist”, had formed a club “personality” that was easily recognizable. </p>
	
		<h2>SAMS Modelist: Vol 1, Number 2, Jan-Feb 1970</h2>
	
		<p>Volume 1, Number 2 of the SAMS Modelist was issued covering January and February of 1970. It appears that the inaugural publication was well received and energized a number of members. This 2nd issue ran 10 pages and contained a number of articles by several contributors. The Modelist staff grew with the addition of Jim Wogstad and Mike Salyers. Jim was an excellent artist and would contribute illustrations for articles. Mike contributed a column featuring newly released products. Don Morgan, who was identified as a non-member, contributed an article on the Curtiss Model 75H, a simplified version of the P-36A. President Phil Fridell’s column also included a mention of “Supercontest”. Phil thanked several individual for their excellent judging skills, but no other information was printed about the event.</p> 
	
		<p>Articles included a single page review authored by Sterling Essenmacher, of the Craft Master (Airfix) B-25, ending with a wish by the author for “good luck” to find the builder, stating that “good luck” would be needed in order to build the kit.</p> 
	
		<p>Phil Friddell contributed an article summarizing the process of converting the Airfix/MPC Bf-109 to an “F”. Phil’s article was followed by an article on an armor kit comparison by Vance Holliday, comparing and contrasting the Revell and Tamiya T34/85. Vance also added a paragraph on scratch-building a 1/48th Pz.KPFW. III/F. This paragraph was labeled as “part 1” 
		of a series of articles on this project. Vance closed out his contribution with a short list of armor kits that were recently released.</p> 
	
		<p>Page 5 of this issue featured a beautifully rendered illustration of an OHKA. There were usual views from above, below, or to the side of the aircraft, as well as some cockpit and interior detail. This drawing was most certainly the work of Jim Wogstad, but Jim’s name does not appear anywhere on the page. </p>
	
		<p>Bob Angel contributed an article on the Fairey Battle, the piece being more of a historical account of the Battle, and concluding with a comment about the Airfix Battle, which was on the market at the time.</p> 
	
		<p>Sharing page 6 with Angel’s Battle is an editorial by President Phil Friddell. The editorial was a rather scathing “call-out” of those members whose attendance at meetings dropped off in the winter months. The article goes on to invite those members to consider approaching the Secretary to drop their member-ship. </p>
	
		<p>Editor Greg Ripps filled page 9 with an article entitled, “The Effect of the Airplane on World War I – Part One”. Consider that, at the time of the publication of this issue of the Modelist, there were still WWI veterans that were alive. Now, some 40 years later, that is not the case. </p>
	
		<p>This issue ends on page 10 with a series of short para-graphs by Mike Salyers, about “recent releases”. Mentioned are the Artiplast G.55, a Hasegawa F-102A, and A.I.R B-254, some decals by MicroScale, DeFrey, and A.B.T., the Monogram P-39 in 1/48th scale, and some publications. </p>
	
		<h2>SAMS Modelist: Vol 1, Number 3, Mar-Apr 1970 </h2>
	
		<p>A number of Hobby Shops supported SAMS during its brief lifetime and Dibbles Hobby Shop is the name that pops up in the newsletter and SAMS history more often than any other. The first “advertisement” of a hobby shop can be seen in this, the 3rd issue of the Modelist. Right there, on the overage, is a small advertisement for Dibbles in the form of an 
		ink stamp image of the return address stamp that Dibbles placed on out-going mail. </p>
	
		<p>On page 1, the President and Editor are listed, as well as the “Artist”; those being Phil Friddell, Gregory Ripps, and James Wogstad, respectively. The Vice President and Secretary of SAMS are not listed. Those contributing to the content of this issue are listed and they are Robert Angel, Frank Emmett, Phillip Friddell, Daniel Hagedorn, Vance Holliday, Donald Morgan, Gregory Ripps, and Michael Salyers. </p>
	
		<p>The President’s Message begins with a “Thanks” for the contributions that have been received by the staff of the Modelist. The President goes on to say that those doubts about the success of the Modelist seems to have faded due to number of contributions being received. President Friddell summarized an idea put forward by member Frank Emmett. Frank said that he would submit a series of “Blow Torch” articles about jet aircraft. This idea, it was intimated, might get some resistance by the “prop” aficionados but that was part of the reason or 
		the planned articles, to widen the view of what can be considered as “interesting aircraft”. This comment certainly reinforces the historical view that MODELIST, as well as the club, were focused on aircraft. President Friddell continues by saying that while Emmett’s article was appreciated, that the drawings accompanying the article were done in pencil, and that pencil drawings could not be printed, and that future contributions were best done in ink.</p> 
	
		<p>Of course, this situation is a far cry from the current technology used by those producing the current of Alamo Squadron, which contain full color images, clip art, and other common components unheard-of in SAMS day. One gets a sense that the MODELIST was beginning to reach that level of quality that those involved with its production had set as their goal. There was genuine quality to the content, as is easily seen in the articles published in these early issues. There was room for improvement, as seen by the instructions to produce artwork 
		to be contributed in ink, and there was also evidence that the MODELIST was reaching modelers outside of the greater San Antonio area.</p> 
	
		<p>One page 1, a letter from a reader in Austin received a copy, and was provided some very positive feedback to the staff. The comments came from Mike McMurtrey, a member of IPMS/Austin at the time of the publishing of this issue of the MODELIST. Even though Mike lauded the effort going into the newsletter, he apparently did not like the name, MODELIST, stating that it sounds rather “awkward”.</p>
		
		<p>Content in this issue Dan Hagedorn contributed an article entitled, “The Douglas B-26 In Latin America”. The article includes some illustrations that appear on page 3. Bob Angel’s article, “Hellcat-A Forgotten Fighter” starts on page 6 and is preceded by some artwork on page 5, and with captions for those illustrations on page 4. Phil Friddell’s “The Problems of Gloss” share page 7, with Bob Angel’s article, Phil addressing a problem that apparently is timeless, still causing grief with model-ers to this day. Don Morgan’s article, “The Boeing P-128B (F3B-1)” may be a misprint since there is a handwritten correction to the title, labeling the subject as an F4B-1. Morgan’s articles reference some “Profile” publications as references and the article also serves to “review” the Monogram kit.</p>
	
		<p>As the President’s Comments mentioned, Frank Emmett’s article, “The Blow Torch” is launched. Emmett quickly acknowledges the “prop” bias of most of the SAMS members, but goes on to state a case for the significance of jet aircraft, and of his growing interest in jets. Mr. Emmett’s intent, as stated in the opening paragraph of his article is that he will present the, “development, use, markings, and the personalities surrounding them”. Further stated is the goal of re-viewing kits, and providing suggestions on modifications and conversions of those kits. Indeed, a lofty task, but it is very much in line with what one finds on the “web” today, and in current publications. In the remainder of the article the author gets down to business by reviewing the Hasegawa RF-101c.</p> 
	
		<p>In the previous issue of the MODELIST, Greg Ripps contributed Part 1 of, “The Effect of the Airplane On World War I”. Part two of this article appears in this issue on page 10. On page 11, Mike Salyers continues his series of reviews of modeling publications, kits, and related products.</p>
	
		<p>While the primary focus of SAMS can be clearly seen as 1/72nd Prop WW II aircraft, Vance Holliday continued to insert some diversity into the MODELIST with his article on scratch building a 1/48th Pz. KPFW III/F (Part III of this article, and a kit review of the Airfix Grant/Lee.</p>
	
		<p>Thus, ends Issue # 3 of the MODELIST. Clearly the publication was a success and there were a number of individuals who were making contributions to each issue rather than leaving the content up to the editor. Behind the scenes it is clear that there was some talk about just who was being represented by the MODELIST, and whether the MODELIST was pushed any particular agenda. In answer to that concern, this issue of the MODELIST, in several articles, clearly stated that the opinions being expressed were those of the authors, and not of the SAMS club or person or group. Readers were free to agree or disagree, and to express their views and to submit content to the Editor.</p>
	
		<p>One gets a sense that SAMS was in good shape and that there was certainly room for those with interests other than Prop 1/72nd models. It appears that the leadership of the club, as well as the MODELIST, were open to criticism, and that those who offered criticism would be invited to offer suggestions and content to the newsletter.</p>
