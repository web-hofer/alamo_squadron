		<p>By Dick Montgomery, IPMS/USA# 14003</p>
		
		 <p>The previous chapter desribed the founding of Alamo Squadron, and four basic points became evident about Alamo Squadron. The first point was how the club became known as Alamo Squadron. There was a typo in that discussion.  Credit for selecting that name, in my opinion still rests with Bob Angel, Ros Creed, and Mike Derderian.</p>
	
		<p>The 2nd basic point was that at this early stage of evolution, the club seemed to operate without an elected set of officers and without a founding document, or a club constitution. Club records report that Roscoe Creed was serving as President by 1978, and it seems logical that since the club was founded in November of the previous year that Roscoe was, therefore, the 1st President of Alamo Squadron.</p>
	
		<p>The 3rd basic point about Alamo Squadron discussed in the previous article was that the club focused on a particular subject matter for models, that being aircraft, and, for the most part, aircraft models in 1/72nd scale.  Keep in mind that in the late 70’s and early 80’s model manufacturers were producing a greater number of 1/48th aircraft than in previous years, but in the 70’s, 1/72nd scale still held sway. The club also continued the publication of a magazine, rather than a newsletter, and that club publication was known as, “Aircraft in Miniature”.</p>
	
		<p>The 4th basic point in the previous article was a short and succinct message in a club newsletter regarding the effort to find a facility in which a “Supercon” could be held. Club members were, by 1981, attempting to organize a model contest along the lines of other modeling clubs in the Central and South Texas area. And that is where we will begin this 2nd article in this series of articles about the history of Alamo Squadron.</p>
	
		<p>The archive is, unfortunately, lacking in club newsletters and documentation from 1981 through 1983, with a few documents archived for 1984. Some of the history can be pieced together via the records that are in the archive and there are some facts that are documented via ModelFiesta notes that can cross over to other aspects of club history. Therefore, this installment will focus on two areas of the evolution of Alamo Squadron, those being some basic data on the organization of the club and then a study of ModelFiestas 1 through 3, from 1982 through 1984.</p>
	 
		<p>From November of 1977, when Alamo Squadron was founded, to September of 1983, those elements of club life that typify most organizations like Alamo Squadron. Some notable dates during this period were:</p>
	
		<ul>
			<li>Nov 11, 1979 – The membership selects the club name to be “IPMS Alamo Squadron”</li>
			<li>1978-1979 – Roscoe Creed serves as President. No other officers are identified. Ros held at position until August of 1980.</li>
			<li>A publication labeled as Aircraft In Miniature began to be published on a somewhat regular basis. AIM resembled the previously described “Modelist”, the publication produced by members of the SAMS club, the predecessor to Alamo Squadron. </li>
			<li>AIM Staff included Lee Bracken as the editor, Bob Angel in charge of layout, and Frank Garcia in charge of production.</li>
		</ul>
	
		<p>Although documentation regarding the identity of officers and having a constitution are not in the archive, the best guess is that Roscoe Creed served as the President in that first year of existence, 1977-1978. As for a founding document, there is no mention of a Constitution in the archives at this early date. Various members volunteered to host club meetings in their homes. At some point in 1979, the club found a site to use for the monthly meetings, that site being the London House Apartments Party Room. At some point in 1980, the club moved its meetings to another apartment property, called “The Bluffs”. In 1981, the club once again relocated to Fatso’s BBQ on Culebra Road, just outside of Loop 410. The club met at Fatso’s until 1984.</p> 
		
		<p>The first mention of demonstration/program conducted during a club meeting is contained in a newsletter dated for Nov 11, 1977. This was the meeting at which those present agreed to establish Alamo Squadron. The meeting, taking place at the London House Apartments featured a presentation on building vacu-formed models by Tom Ward.</p>
		
		<p>By 1981 the club had evolved into an enthusiastic organization with active members who were pursuing two clear objectives. The first objective was to encourage and aid the publication of “Aircraft In Miniature”. AIM was billed, not as a club publication/newsletter, but rather as a modeling magazine. The second objective was to host a contest not only for the club membership, but to invite modelers in the greater San Antonio area and from clubs in other cities.</p>
	
		<p>We know that the club was successful in the development of an annual contest as shown by the record-setting entry numbers from the 2018 event, ModelFiesta 37 with over 800 entries. That number represents the largest number of entries in any contest in the IPMS Region 6 area, excluding the Oklahoma City and the Dallas IPMS National Conventions.</p>
