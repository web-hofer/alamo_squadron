			By Dick Montgomery, IPMS/USA# 14003
			</p>

			<p>
			Alamo Squadron, by April 2014 was in the middle of its 36th year. The club, and its membership, continued to participate in, or organize various modeling activities. One of the more notable activities within the five-state area that makes up IPMS Region 6 ( TX OK, AR, KS, LA.) dealt with a model display aboard the USS Lexington located in Corpus Christi, Tx. The July club newsletter ran an article about the origins of the Scale Model Exhibit on the USS Lexington. Randy Barnes, a member of Alamo Squadron, had noticed back in 2008 that while there were models on display aboard the “Lex”, the display was generally in rather bad condition. Randy pitched a proposal that he had developed to improve the display, and in the intervening years, Randy was spectacularly successful. To this day, the “Lex” display rates as one of the best this author has seen throughout the U.S. The newsletters published in 2014 showed that the club continued to enjoy monthly contests at the meetings, presentations and demos of modeling techniques, and, of course, ModelFiesta, which was hosted in February at the San Antonio Event Center located just off Loop 410 near Marbach Rd.
			</p>

			<p>
			In April, when elections for all club offices were held, the club selected Tom Sprawls to serve as the President. Art Nicholson was chosen to serve as the Vice President, and Dick Montgomery was chosen to serve as the Treasurer. In the summer of 2014 Tom Sprawls relocated to Salt Lake City for a job opportunity. Art Nicholson assumed the Presidency. Henry Nunez was invited to serve as the Vice President and accepted the offer. In the September issue of the club newsletter, it was announced that Henry Nunez had accepted the appointment to the Vice Presidency that had been offered to him.
			</p>

			<p>
			The club newsletters throughout the remainder of 2014, and during the first months of 2015 revealed that there was a great deal of activity. The ABC course, created by Lee Forbes and Tony Ivone, was mentioned. The ABC had a history of being a good recruiting tool not only for the club but also for IPMS. The program has evolved over the intervening years and now exists as a “Build Day” held at a local HobbyTown USA. Techniques are shared, kits are discussed, and it is a fun experience for all. The WIP (Works in Progress) portion of the meeting continued to see some very interesting projects, and in ever increasing numbers. Programs during the meetings covered a variety of modeling subjects, from scratch-built, to armor, aircraft, autos, ships, and figures.
			</p> 

			<p>
			In April 2015, Dick Montgomery was elected as President, Henry Nunez was chosen as the Vice President, and Lee Washburn was selected as Treasurer. This E-Board set out its goals that “trended” the club toward a different path than that which the club had been tracking for a number of years. One of the first issues to be met dealt with the finances of the club and the club’s status as a social organization.
			</p>

			<p>
			In 2014 the club was informed that the nature of the club’s checking account with a local bank was in need of a change. Since, almost from the origin of the club through 2014, the club checking account was, in nature, similar to any personal account that an individual might obtain. In 2014 the bank indicated that a change was mandated. The club account was morphed into a “small business” account, or an account that would be similar to that assigned to a small entrepreneurship. When announced to the membership, the arrangement set off some discussion regarding Alamo Squadron being changed into a “small business” with a club member being identified as the owner of the business. After some discussions with some banking institutions, and with some suggestions from several CPAs, that arrangement was ended. Alamo Squadron registered with the IRS as a 501c7. The bank and those CPAs who volunteered some time as informal advisors indicated that the club, by its very nature, matched the qualifications as a 501c7. Generally, a 501c7 is a social organization, primarily supported by funds paid by their members. “c7’s” are tax exempt. This stipulation requires that the club be a “social club” with membership limited to those who adhere to the social nature of the organization. The club’s organizational structure must be aimed at pleasure, recreation, and other non-profitable purposes.
			</p>

			<p>
			After some rather difficult and tedious paperwork was submitted and approved by the IRS, Alamo Squadron became a 501c7, and that information was shared with the bank in which the club held an account. The bank pushed all the proper buttons on their computers and that was that. Now, each year the 501c7 status is renewed, online, with a series of 7 or 8 questions being answered. Of those questions, most deal with the name and address of the person who serves as the President or Treasurer, and some basic questions about the club. Only one question points at the finances and that question asks if the club’s profits exceeded $50,000 in the previous tax year. The answer, of course, is always a negative response. And that ends the steps the club needs to take each year in regard to taxes and to its 501c7. 
			</p>

			<p>
			What could have become a major sticking point in the financial status of the club was resolved, and then was verified during a phone conversation with an IRS agent. The agent was confirming the approval of the 501c7 application. The agent mentioned that the status of a “small business” caused more scrutiny then such accounts for similar clubs received, but after some discussion it was clear that the agent knew an error had been made. The impression was that this situation was not uncommon. In any case, the transition to a registered 501c7 was the proper course for the club to take and that, in the future, all that was necessary was the annual completion of the online “renewal” form.
			</p>

			<p>
			Since this transformation of the club’s status has taken place, each of the three previous E-Boards and the current E-Board have handled renewal on time, and without issue. Clearly, as E-Boards transition in the future it is incumbent upon the outgoing and incoming E-Board members that they are very much aware of the action that must take place each year to renew the 501c7 status (there is no fee for doing so), and to know the process that must be followed in order to go online and go through the short procedure to complete the renewal form.
			</p>

			<p>
			Each of the E-Boards for 2015-2016, 2016-2017, 2017-2018, and 2018-2019 also made other changes in procedures dealing with club finances. One of those procedures dealt with the budget for ModelFiesta. In the past, ModelFiesta, at times, had a budget, but that budget wasn’t presented to the membership, and seldom was there open discussion about the budget. By 2015 the club had arrived at the point at which there were insufficient resources to hold the “next” ModelFiesta if the most current ModelFiesta was not profitable, or worse, if the income did not, at the least, meet the expenses of the show.
			</p>

			<p>
			The E-Boards during these 4 years instituted a new policy in which the Event Director was directed to generate a budget for ModelFiesta, and then, to remain within that budget, exceeding anticipated expenses only with the approval of the E-Board. This procedure is still in place. Those ModelFiestas that were impacted by this procedure were ModelFiestas 35, 36, 37, and the upcoming MF-38. 
			</p>

			<p>
			To the credit of the Event Directors for these recent ModelFiestas, their budget requests were based on past expenses, and with changes in the processes and procedures within ModelFiesta, itself. Such actions as a focus on acquiring sponsorships for trophy packages, and a careful study of areas in which expenses could be reduced.
			</p>

			<p>
			Rob Booth directed ModelFiesta 35 and Len Pilhofer directed ModelFiestas 36, 37, and 38. In all four ModelFiestas, the events made profits due to the careful planning and organization of these two Event Directors, and the leadership provided by the ModelFiesta staffers. Attendance rose for each of these three events to “top out” with the highest count of entries for any ModelFiesta at 817 entries. During this time the club treasury has most certainly grown to a point in which the club and ModelFiesta are now assured for the next three years.
			</p>

			<p>
			The E-Boards during these four years did well in meeting one of the three main goals that those E-Boards laid out for their respective terms, that goal being “actively seeking was to reduce club expenses and increase club financial resources”.  As evidence of that goal having been met by each E-Board, the members are provided with the current club account balance each month by the Treasurer, and also with a description of any non-standard expenses incurred by the club, should any such expenses occur. In fact, during a previous review of the club Constitution it became a requirement for the club account balance to be provided to the membership present at each monthly meeting.
			</p>

			<p>
			The 2nd of the three goals laid out and agreed to by each of the E-Boards over this 4 year period of time was, “encourage the development of leadership among the membership". This goal is important on many levels. Alamo Squadron is certainly a “social organization” but it is also a “social organism”. It is a living, breathing organism. That organism grows and thrives when its constituent parts (the members) act in a coordinated effort toward common goals. Not everyone has to serve as an officer or ModelFiesta Event Director. Not everyone can fill these roles. Some have jobs, children, or other professional and social obligations that they focus their attention and time upon. But all can volunteer to serve in some fashion during ModelFiesta, and some can share their particular modeling skills and techniques by presenting and demonstrating those techniques at a meeting. And all, regardless of their length of membership, modeling skill, or interests can, and should, support the club by an awareness of the club’s goals, history, and Constitutional processes and procedures. In short, everyone can participate by simply being at the meetings, asking questions, and participating in various club function.
			</p>

			<p>
			Certainly, during the last four administrations, the officers have shown their support for this 2nd goal, that of encouraging the development of new leadership within the club. Each of these club members (Dana Mathes, Dick Montgomery, Henry Nunez, Len Pilhofer, Herb Scranton, Jose Valdenegro, and Lee Washburn) have served as officers, and as Staffers at ModelFiesta. And each has made a distinct effort to share their knowledge and expertise with others, who, hopefully will continue to help the club grow. Some of these individuals are either going to serve on the Leadership Team for the upcoming ModelFiesta 38, or they will be available to those who are chosen to serve on the next E-Board, to offer their knowledge of how things work.
			</p>

			<p>
			And lastly, the 3rd goal to which these four E-Boards have adhered is to, provide a continuing series of programs, presentations, and demonstrations that inspire active participation among the membership. Alamo Squadron’s goals are, as expressed in the Constitution, “to cultivate and promote an interest in the hobby of model building by creating a bond of friendship, good fellowship, and the exchange of information to foster the improvement in individual model building skills.” It is rather easy to see how the club meets this purpose statement.
			</p> 

			<p>
			If you’ve attended any of the recent Alamo Squadron Build Days (as of summer of 2019), you’ll see members, and non-member guests, sharing their interest and the hobby. That certainly addressed the “good fellowship” aspect of the club’s purpose. Some can’t make it to the Build Days, but they share good fellowship with other members and guests on the club’s FaceBook page. Over the four administrations since 2015, a major focus has been the scheduling of demonstrations, filling the program time slot at club meetings. This effort directly addresses the 3rd stated purpose of Alamo Squadron, that being “the exchange of information to foster the improvement in individual model building skills.” 
			</p>

			<p>
			The membership has seen demonstrations such as Len Pilhofer’s May 2016 demo on soldering PE parts and Lee Forbes’ demonstration of the use of Future during the decaling process. Members have seen demonstrations on rigging aircraft, different types of sanding materials, and types of putties. The W.I.P. (Works in Progress) allows for members to view modeling projects from their earliest stages of construction to the finished model which is often entered in the monthly club contest. The monthly program, the WIP, and the monthly club contest are definitely feeding off each other and certainly contributing to the growth of modeling skill among the members.
			</p>

			<p>
			The three “purposes” for which Alamo Squadron was created, and for which it continues to address certainly make a difference in the enjoyment of the hobby by its membership. The outstanding leadership that Alamo Squadron has experienced, and the participation of the membership in various roles during the course of the years, has led the club into a rather elite position, not shared by many modeling clubs around the country. The club is now in its early 40’s, with members that participate in programs such as the Model Summit Program (thanks Craig Gregory), Build Days, the WIP program, monthly model contests with an annual Best Model of the Year contest from among the winners of the monthly contests, continuing donations to the IPMS Support the Troops program, an excellent club newsletter, “The Navigator”, an active FaceBook page and a club website, continuing the IPMS chapter charter status, and with members participating in local shows in Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, and New Mexico, and Oklahoma. Alamo Squadron has been the host chapter for a number of IPMS Region 6 conventions. Our club members have a long history of attendance at IPMS National Conventions at which members have served on the convention staff as volunteers, given presentations on various topics, served as judges, and have brought home awards for their winning entries. Four Alamo Squadron members have gone international, visiting the UK several times to attend the Telford IPMS/UK convention. Most recently, Rob Booth and Dick Montgomery entered models in the contest, but also served as judges, a rather unique experience. It should be noted that Rob came home with a Gold Medal, and Dick came home with his entry stuffed in his dirty socks in his suitcase.
			</p>

			<p>
			It should also be noted that the future for Alamo Squadron is quite bright. Our members to travel to the shows hosted by other IPMS and AMPS clubs in our five-state area, and often serve as judges as well as returning with their share of trophies. The numbers at ModelFiesta continue to grow and actually hit an all-time high of 817 entries at ModelFiesta 37 in February 2018. Vendor space is usually a sellout each year.
			</p> 

			<p>
			Finally, it should be noted that Alamo Squadron members, with the support of members from a number of IPMS Region 6 clubs, presented a proposal, while at the Phoenix Convention in 2018, to host the 2020 IPMS National Convention . Here’s a little background on tis proposal and related effort: A previous proposal had been presented during the 2016 Nats to host the show in 2018, but the 2018 show instead went to Phoenix. During the Omaha convention in 2017, three club members agreed that it was time to make an effort for the Nats. Those three members were Rob Booth, Len Pilhofer, and Dick Montgomery, who, by coincidence, had car-pooled to Omaha. The ride home was close to 18 hours and by hour #10, the bid outline had been jotted down with Len being picked as the Bid Organizer and Event Chairman. 
			</p>

			<p>
			There were a good number of team members in attendance at Phoenix when Len presented the bid, with representatives of a number of other Region 6 clubs who had signed off on the bid to give it support at the meeting in which bids were presented. Len nailed the presentation and all but assured Alamo Squadron would host the 2020 National Convention. A number of Region 6 modelers were at the table with Len and other Alamo Squadron attendees during the Awards Banquet.  The announcement of Alamo Squadron’s winning bid was met with great enthusiasm and anticipation by those individuals, as well as by the audience of some 400+ banquet attendees.
			</p>

			<p>
			Other recognitions have come to Alamo Squadron over the years. Alamo Squadron was selected as the IPMS Region 6 Chapter of the Year as well as the IPMS National Chapter of the Year twice. An Alamo Squadron member served in staff positions for IPMS as Regional Coordinator and on the IPMS National E-Board in three different offices. Several members have served for a number of years as National Judges at IPMS Conventions with Lee Forbes receiving his 25-year pin for his service as a Nats judge. Two members have recently had articles published in the IPMS Journal, most recently Len Pilhofer’s article about installing LED lights in a Star Trek kit.
			</p>

			<p>
			Alamo Squadron’s membership has had gains and losses over the years. In some cases, we’ve lost members due to their passing from age or poor health. Members have helped the families to manage the disposal of the modeling tools, references, and kits of those deceased members on the occasion when our services were requested. We’ve also lost members who had to relocate due to job opportunities. We still see some of those former members at contests that we attend in other states or at the National Convention. In some cases, members simply cut ties with the club. The causes of these departures are numerous, in some cases being regrettable, but in most cases being one of a personal decision, to spend more time in other endeavors.
			</p>

			<p>
			Today, Alamo Squadron is a social organization in which all modelers are accepted and invited to join in the fun. The club has members who have interests in all genres of modeling, with no genre being excluded and all being accepted. The club has members for whom their time of leadership has passed and some for whom their time of leadership is not far away, or even right now and in the next few months as the club approaches its annual election cycle in April.  Alamo Squadron honors those who have led and served, and also encourages members to volunteer their time and talent either in the present or future. Alamo Squadron depends upon the membership to volunteer to serve in some capacity, and the club continues to thrive because members do, indeed volunteer, and participate as Members of IPMS Alamo Squadron. </p>

			<p>
			Alamo Squadron has manifested itself as a very successful social organization with a very interesting history over the last 40 years. I wonder who those “future” members will be and how they will contribute to Alamo Squadron, ensuring a positive and vibrant club with a great history over the next 40 years?
