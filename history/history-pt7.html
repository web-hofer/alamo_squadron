			By May, 1986 Alamo Squadron had shown that the club and its membership could hold a successful annual event (ModelFiesta). 
			Even though there were a few results that could not be described as “successful”, the first five ModelFiestas, and especially 
			IV and V, established a strong foundation upon which Alamo Squadron was to build ModelFiesta into one of the larger “local” events 
			held in Texas. Thanks to those who travel to ModelFiesta each year, we all (the modeling community in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, 
			Arkansas, Louisiana, other parts of the USA, and Mexico) benefit from an event that is enjoyable and stimulating. And, as a social 
			organization, Alamo Squadron was functioning well, led by members with the leadership skills, supported by members who helped Alamo 
			Squadron continue its positive evolution as a modeling club. That having been said, there were two issues that caused dissention 
			and unrest with Alamo Squadron, and to the point at which some members withdrew from the club and never returned. The first of these 
			issues centered on the procedures and practices followed at ModelFiesta, and the other focused on the very nature of the club, itself.
			</p>

			<p>
			Before launching into these two challenges faced by Alamo Squadron, a brief summary of the Officers and club staffers will serve 
			to shine a well-deserved spotlight on the members that served the club during the mid 1980’s. The second major issue that was alluded 
			to previously is addressed in the article summarizing ModelFiesta VII which can be found in the ModelFiesta archives
			<!--link to modelfiesta archive MFVII-->. The first issue, that of the “nature” of the club, follows the list of officers shown below.

		<h2>The Nature of Alamo Squadron</h2>
	
			<p>
			From Alamo Squadron’s roots with the San Antonio Modeler’s Society, and in the first decade and a half of the history of Alamo Squadron, the primary focus, and at times, the only focus of modeling interest by the majority of members was aircraft. There were a few members with interests outside of aircraft, however, the newsletters in the archive clearly show that almost all presentations, demos, and programs that were scheduled for club meetings revolved around aircraft.
			</p>

			<p>
			During the mid-1980’s and late 1980’s a small contingent of members began to advocate for a change in the name of the club. Their view was that the label, “Alamo Squadron” was an indication that the club was aircraft-centered. There is no doubt that this was, in fact, the case. A study of the programs, demonstrations, and presentations that were scheduled at the monthly meetings supported this view. A series of debates at a few club meetings led to a parting of the ways. A majority of the club membership favoring remaining with the by-now well known and historical brand of Alamo Squadron. Some of the comments made during the debate were along the lines of the term, Squadron, not only being used for aircraft, but also for ships, sci-fi spacecraft (Star Wars, etc.), and armor formations. In the end, the view that carried the greatest weight was that the branding of the club as Alamo Squadron was important in the sense of name recognition, and for historical consistency. Some of the members could not accept this view and they left Alamo Squadron and met as a newly formed group. Some friendships and acquaintanceships were ended by this unfortunate event, but in the long run the debate had a very positive effect on Alamo Squadron. The documentation in the archive shows that this time period was a turning point in the nature of the club, and that, as the years rolled by, Alamo Squadron evolved into a social organization that not only accepted the idea that all modeling genres were of interest, and that all genres of modeling should be accepted and encouraged by the club and its membership. That view is now a hallmark of Alamo Squadron. Today (2019), and for many years preceding 2019, there has been a 
			strong contingent of auto modelers, real space and sci-fi modelers, armor modelers, Gunpla enthusiasts, and figure painters. If there’s a model of “it”, there’s an Alamo Squadron member who builds “it”.
			</p>

			<p>
			Meanwhile, back at the club meetings: during 1985-86 the club met at what was then called the SASA Building. That facility is now called the Pyramid (due to its unique shape) and is currently the home of SNB- or S Bank, located near the intersection of 281North/Loop 410. Interestingly, the Dec, 1986 club newsletter identifies John Collins as the Program Chairman, and also indicates that John would video-tape upcoming programs. Future programs were identified as, “Glues and Fillers”, “Paints and Airbrushing”, a Swap Meet, and films from Randolph AFB.
			</p>

			<p>
			During 1986 and 1987, the club began to show an interest in genres of modeling other than aircraft. The April 1987 club newsletter documents that John Collins was going to present a program on weathering ships. The paragraph stated that even though most club members did not build ships, John’s weathering techniques were applicable to non-ship subjects.
			</p>

			<p>
			John also made a very significant and long-lasting contribution to Alamo Squadron. John was the creator of the logo that Alamo Squadron now uses and the official club logo.
