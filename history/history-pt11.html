		In 2005, the Constitution went through a review/amendment process. One of the changes involved the timing of elections and the assumption of duties by the newly elected E-Board members. Prior to the change, the election was held in September with the officers taking up their duties, generally after the conclusion of the September meeting. The cycle of service for Officers was amended so that they would begin their term of service in April. One of the primary reasons for this change was the juxtaposition of the newly elected officers assuming their duties and the date for ModelFiesta. In previous years, with Officers not taking on their duties until September/October, issues arose with communication and coordination between the E-Board and the ModelFiesta Leadership Team. Even more importantly, the E-Board was not in an optimum position to oversee the budget of the upcoming event, and to work with the ModelFiesta Leadership Team to make sure that the event presented the philosophy of the club to the participants who came to join in this “celebration of modeling”.
		</p>	

		<p>
		2005 also marked a change in leadership within the club. For the next nine years, leadership of the club was assumed by members who, for the most part, had not previously held any elective office, but who had a great deal of “staff” experience, mostly working on the club newsletter or on the ModelFiesta Staff.

		You will notice that, in some cases, there is more than one name listed for the office of the President and the Vice President. During the 2012 April to 2013 April term, Bill Gates was elected as Vice President. Bill stepped away from the office and Kent Knebel was appointed to fill that vacancy. Then, again in 2013 April to 2014 April, Dee Jacobs was 
		elected as the President and Jerry Escobedo was elected as the Vice President. Dee relocated to the Mississippi area on a job-related move, so the Vice President, Jerry Escobedo, 
		was sworn in as the President. Tom Sprawls became the Vice President. Of these members who volunteered to serve, and to sacrifice a considerable amount of their modeling time to 
		handle club business, five remain as members some 4 to13 years after serving the club. A number of these former officers are still annual participants at ModelFiesta and are actively engaged in the hobby. Some have relocated to other states, mostly for job related reasons.

		The club newsletters during this same period of time show that the club was participating in a number of community outreach programs. For example, the October 2015 newsletter 
		contained an article about a Make-N-Take in which club members volunteered to serve as coaches, and which HobbyTown-USA
