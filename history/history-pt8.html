			By the early 1990’s Alamo Squadron had come of age. Membership had expanded to numbers ranging from 30 to 40, ModelFiesta had changed venues several times and had continued to attract an ever-increasing number of contestants and entries. A club constitution had been adopted and had undergone some edits through amendments, conflicts of opinion regarding the procedures followed in ModelFiesta had taken place and been resolved, and club leadership had transferred from members who were plank-owners to members who had joined the club following its founding years.</p> 

			<p>
			Club officers during 1991-1992 were Charlie Moriarty (President), Mike Haggerty (Vice President) and Bob Carr (Sec/Treasurer). Charlie is a Life Member of Alamo Squadron and is a regular visitor at each year’s ModelFiesta. Documentation indicates that Charlie held office only this one term. Bob Carr served as an officer in a number of years and continues his membership in Alamo Squadron to this date (2019). As with Charlie, the records show that Mike held an office only during the 1991-1992 time frame.
			</p>

			<p>
			For the most part, it was business as usual for Alamo Squadron throughout 1991. Clubs often face issues about a meeting site, always wishing to find a site that is free, and large enough to hold the club membership. In March of 1991 Alamo Squadron was informed that their meeting site at St. Thomas Episcopal Church notified the club that there would no longer be space for the club meeting to be held at the Church. The club leadership announced that the next few meetings would take place at Gatti’s Pizza in the 6800 block of Huebner Road. By May of 1991, the situation regarding a new meeting site was beginning to have a major impact on the club. There were sites available, but they would be made available only at a substantial cost to the club.
			</p>

			<p>
			And, as had become Standard Operating Procedure, the newsletter and meeting prior to ModelFiesta focused on job responsibilities, materials and equipment, and a discussion as to procedures that would be in place at the February show.
			</p>
	
			<p>
			Newsletters throughout 1991 contained kit reviews, book reviews, announcements of upcoming programs at club meetings, and information about individuals wishing the sell their collections.
			</p>
	
			<p>
			The September 1991 newsletter contained two interesting bits of information. First, Tom Ward had secured a site for club meetings at the San Antonio Association of Life Underwriters building on Loop 410, near Babcock. The newsletter also indicated that Tom assured the membership that he, personally, did not receive renumeration from the building owners in return for the club’s use of some space. The second item of business was that the C&BL had been amended to delete the requirement that club officers also held IPMS membership.</p>

			<p>
			In Oct of 1992 a new E-Board was installed following the annual club elections. Bobby Smith was elected as President, Frank Stiles became the Vice President, and Dick Montgomery was selected as the Secretary-Treasurer. Interestingly, Tom Ward had been advocating for a position to be created for a club historian. In October, the new E-Board invited Tom to serve as that Historian, the position being an informal.
			</p>

			<p>
			During the early 1990’s the officers were following the practice of inviting members to offer presentations/demonstrations at the monthly meetings. The archive indicates, for example, that in November of 1992 the program would be demos by Bob Angel and John O’Brien featuring scribing and putty work. In December, following those presentation, Bob Davies would offer a presentation regarding the “workspace”.
			</p>

			<p>
			In October of 1993 the newsletter contained a membership list. It is interesting to note that two of those members listed were Founding Members of the club, and who are, to this day (Sept, 2018) still members of Alamo Squadron. Those two individuals are Bob Angel and Dick Montgomery. Of equal note, there are four current members who also appear on that membership roster. Those members are Bob Carr, Lee Forbes, Charlie Moriarty and David Walker.
			</p>

			<p>
			Unfortunately, the records covering most of 1993 are few and far between. A new E-Board was elected in September of 1993 but the records indicate only that the President who served to September of 1994 was Gordon Ziegler.
			</p>
	
			<p>
			The club, by 1995 was in good shape and continuing to expand its hallmark annual event, ModelFiesta. The categories offered at ModelFiesta were continuing to evolve. In some cases, it was one step backward and two forward. The introduction of popular voting being used to select award winners was attempted, with results that resulted in a return to the Committee system. Those personality conflicts that arose were resolved, most agreeably so, some with the departure of a member. The club was sound financially, populated with members who represented a wide range of modeling interests, and with an annual event that had established itself 
			as one of the larger events in a five-state region.
