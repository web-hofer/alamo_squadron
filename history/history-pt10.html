			By Dick Montgomery, IPMS/USA# 14003
			</p>

			<p>
			As Alamo Squadron celebrated the arrival of the New Millennium the signs of a strong and stable club were visible. ModelFiesta had continued to be a very successful event.
			ModelFiestas 15 through 19 had averaged 554 entries and each had resulted in a profit sufficient to host the following year’s show. (The average entry count of 554 is based on the entry numbers of 4 of the events, with the entry total for the fifth event, ModelFiesta 17 not having been recorded.) 
			</p>

			<p>
			Contributing to the stability of the club, the location for club meetings remained fixed in one location, that being the HEB Central Market (for those not familiar with San Antonio, HEB is THE grocery store chain in the area) on Broadway, not far from the San Antonio Zoo. The membership of the club was consistently in the 40 to 45-member range throughout the years covered in this article. 
			</p>

			<p>
			During the first five years of New Millennium, the list of those serving as club officers showed six members that held office for the first time, while only two offices were assumed by members who had previously served on the Executive Board. Many hold the view that having new faces appearing on the Executive Board is a sign that the club is in good condition and has a wide range of members with leadership skills that are important to all organizations like modeling clubs. 
			</p>

			<p>
			In September of 2000, Rob Booth served as President, Jim Stroud as Vice President, and Lee Forbes as Sec/Treasurer. As the newly installed President, Rob laid out those goals which the E-Board would pursue over the next year. Bob Carr was producing the club newsletter but was searching for someone to assume that role. Lee Forbes was encouraging members to volunteer for service at those duty stations that must be manned at each ModelFiesta event, especially at the ModelFiesta to be held in February, 2001. That ModelFiesta would also 
			be labeled as the IPMS Region 6 Regional Convention, one of several Regional Events that were hosted by Alamo Squadron.
			</p> 

			<p>
			In November of 2000 several items of interest found their way into the club newsletter. Chris Lenahan (now a member of the Houston club) proposed that the club support the Elf Louise Project (a city-wide effort to gather donations of gifts for those less fortunate in the greater San Antonio area each year in December). In a later newsletter, Chris reported that the club had donated some 30 kits and various supplies and toys to Elf Louise. Lee Forbes announced that shirts and caps sporting the Club Logo would be available for order. 
			If memory serves, these items were black with the Logo being printed in yellow. Today, you can spot the “old-timers” because, on occasion, they still wear these vestments. 
			</p>

			<p>
			At the December meeting Lee Forbes nominated Bob Carr as the first recipient of the Alamo Squadron Distinguished Service Award. The nomination was sup-ported by the membership and the DSA was awarded to Bob at the January 2001 meeting. The December meeting for the club usually includes a White Elephant Gift Exchange and that activity served as the program for the December meeting. 
			</p>

			<p>
			In the first four months of 2001, newsletters from those months mentioned the build-up to ModelFiesta repeatedly. Volunteers were encouraged to step forward and the club received updates from the ModelFiesta leadership team on a routine basis. Bob Carr was still searching for someone to assume the Editorship of the newsletter. In the April 2001 issue of the club newsletter, a brief article announced that an advisory aoard had been created. The purpose of this board was to offer suggestions and comments regarding the planning process for the annual ModelFiesta event. Three members with extensive leader-ship experience with ModelFiesta were appointed to the Board, those members being Lee Forbes, Paul Lemmon, and Dick Montgomery. A “How To” manual was assembled and made available to future ModelFiesta Leadership Teams. Unfortunately, the manual was not consulted by those running the shows, and, in time, the manual simply disappeared. (Today, there is a wealth of information regarding the organization, planning and execution of ModelFiesta available to the Leadership Team. Content was provided by Rob Booth and Len Pilhofer, with contributions from Dick Montgomery. This documentation is in digital format and will not disappear as did the first manual).
			</p>

			<p>
			In July 2001 the Newsletter contained an article which covered a nomination, put forward by Lee Forbes, for a 2nd Distinguished Service Award to be presented to another Alamo Squadron member. Bob Carr had been presented with the inaugural DSA, and this 2nd award went to Dick Montgomery.
			</p> 

			<p>
			In October 2001, a new E-Board was elected. James Surrat was elected as President. John O’Brien was chosen to serve as the Vice President, and Lee Forbes was elected to serve as the Secretary/Treasurer. 
			</p>

			<p>
			In March of 2002, A slight change in the club’s procedures for its monthly in-house contest was made. Starting with those models winning a 1st place in the monthly contest, and Best Model of the Year award would be presented, chosen from those 1st place winners over the previous monthly contests. The first recipient of this award was Joe Bianco for an A6M1 Seiran. Also reported in the March Newsletter was that Dick Montgomery had been appointed as the new Region 6 IPMS Coordinator. (In 2002 the IPMS Chapters in IPMS/USA had been divided into 12 regions. Region 6, then and now, includes chapters in Texas, New Mexico, Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and parts of Kansas.) Alamo Squadron now was the home chapter for a person serving in a staff role for IPMS. It was a first for Alamo Squadron, but other Texas clubs had been home base for Region 6 Coordinators as well. 
			</p>

			<p>
			Sept 2002 marked another election cycle and in this instance, the current E-Board was re-elected to serve a second term. Again, the Presidency went to James Surratt, with John O’Brien serving as V.P., and Bob Carr serving as Sec/Treasurer. As it turned out, this would be the last time that Surratt and O’Brien would hold office. Bob Carr served several terms on future E-Boards. 
			</p>

			<p>
			Two of the more serious problems all clubs face, at some point or other, are: how money is handled and by whom, and the disruption in club activities caused by personality clashes. 2003 saw the surfacing of one of the problems that many chapters face. Quoting from the “Presidential Soapbox” penned by President James Surratt, “The reports of my demise have been greatly exaggerated. Due to extreme differences of opinion, I as president had stepped down in the month of May. After a few chats with a couple of members, and some passing of time, I decided to fulfill my term as president.” 
			</p>

			<p>
			So, 10 months into his 2nd term as President, James Surratt was considering his resignation. After some advice and comments by unnamed members, he decided to finish out his term. Kudos to Surratt for this decision. It is a bumpy road for all concerned, included the club as a viable organization, when an officer must leave, or decides to leave their position prior to the regularly scheduled elections. Surratt’s name does not reappear as an officer and, if memory serves, he stepped away from club membership at the end of his term or 
			shortly thereafter. In the view of this writer, Surratt found a positive and viable solution to this personality clash. In the following election cycle, October of 2003, Joe Bianco was elected as President, Tony Ivone served as Vice President, and Bob Carr served as Sec/ Treasurer. 
			</p>

			<p>
			Between November 2003 and April 2004, Bob Carr’s desire to find a volunteer to take over as Newsletter Editor was finally fulfilled. Records show that Carr had served as Editor of the Newsletter from June 1993 to Nov 2011. Records are not precise as to the exact month that Bob began his service as editor, and when that service came to an end. The first and last dates could slide a few months both earlier to start and later to conclude. Bob did an outstanding job with the newsletter and his time and effort are very much appreciated by 
			those who were members at the time. Art Nicholson took over as newsletter editor and the first newsletter on file under his watch is the April 2004 issue. 
			</p>

			<p>
			One of the articles in the April 2004 issue reported that there were 680+ entries at the 2004 ModelFiesta, with at least 700 individual models on the contest tables. This number contrasts with a total of 659 entries, this number being reached by a hand-count of entries listed on the entry forms that were available for such research after the contest had concluded. In the pages following there will be additional comments on this “entry count” as well as some other in-formation regarding model entry numbers for Model- Fiestas 20 
			through 25. 
			</p>

			<p>
			A significant model-related activity was mentioned in some of the newsletters in 2004. Tony Ivone and Lee Forbes had designed a program to help new modelers learn the techniques and skills that would help them develop their ability to build models at a high level of quality. The ABC program (Adult Building Class) taught the basics of model building, these skills and techniques being demonstrated by an instructor. Over the years the ABC certainly made a difference in the abilities that some new modelers were able to master, and served 
			as a “gateway” to club membership for a large number of the participants who joined Alamo Squadron due to their experience in the ABC. 
			</p>

			<p>
			The September 2004 newsletter mentioned that Dick Montgomery was awarded the IPMS RC of the Year Award at the IPMS National Convention in August of 2004. Alamo Squadron could now 
			claim to have been the birthplace of the ABC and the home chapter of the RC of the Year, 2004. In fact, the President of IPMS, Dave Morrissette, asked Alamo Squadron to provide a 
			“Concept Paper” on the ABC for possible use by IPMS in the future. 
			</p>

			<p>
			In October 2004, another election cycle saw Tony Ivone elected as President, Lee Forbes as Vice Presi-dent and Bob Carr as Sec/Treasurer. This would be the final office in which Tony Ivone and Bob Carr would serve. Tony and his wife relocated to Florida. Tony, however, soon joined a model club in Florida and, in fact, was appointed as IPMS Regional Coordinator 
			for Region 11. As mentioned earlier, there are two issues which cause disruption within many clubs, those issues being personality conflicts and money. 
			</p>

			<p>
			It was during the time frame from 2001 to 2006 that the 2nd of those critical problems mentioned above took place. An issue arose regarding the club treasury. In this case, money was not missing, but the records for income, deposit, and management were brought into question. At one point, the club administration turned to the IPMS Regional Coordinator for input. The RC was Dick Montgomery, and there was some information shared with those who attended a meeting with the RC. Research by the RC had found that of the 20+ IPMS chapters in Region 6, a number of them had reported issues with their treasuries. In some cases, club money was being used for non-club related activities. In most cases these funds were reimbursed to the club, but not in a timely manner, not with club consent, and certainly not in every case, the RC shared that In other cases, a club member had simply absconded with the club treasury. The situation in Alamo Squadron certainly did not reach the level of disquiet that was seen in other chapters, but what became clear were a number of conclusions: that the Executive Board needed to be aware of the club balance, and that any use of club funds needed the oversite and approval of all three E-Board members; that such transactions should be based on a published budget, and that a statement regarding the club’s financial status should be made available to the membership at each and every meeting. 
			</p>

			<p>
			A club meeting was set aside for open discussion of this issue, and Rob Booth was asked to serve as the moderator for this meeting. The result was that it was clearly determined that no money had gone missing, and that club deposits would be made in such a manner that the club balance would be reported by the bank, at the amount that was determined to be correct and accurate. 
			</p>

			<p>
			At the end of this meeting it was clear that club finances and the management of those finances should be made tranparent to the membership, and that oversight by the EB was critical. Rob did a superior job making sure that the outcome of this meeting provided a positive path forward for the club and its leadership. To this day, members will hear the Treasurer give an oral report to the club’s financial balance at each meeting and if questions are asked, the E-Board is expected to respond with facts and numbers. Other changes in procedure are a bit less noticeable, but still on record. Lastly, the ModelFiesta leadership Team must submit a proposed event budget to the E-Board and then stay within that budget or seek the approval of the E-Board to increase the budget. During the next few years an effort to amend the Constitution and to codify procedures as mentioned above were incorporated into the C&BL. The club, to this day, continues to operate under these rules and requirements.
