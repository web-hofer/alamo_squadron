		<p>By Dick Montgomery, IPMS/USA# 14003</p>
		
		<p>In previous articles in this journey through the history of Alamo Squadron, we focused on the first few years of the San Antonio Modelers Society, better known as SAMS. We saw SAMS organized as the 1st plastic modeling club in San Antonio, and we saw that SAMS had an official publication known as “The Modelist”. That publication was not a newsletter but was actually a “modeling magazine” with kit reviews, articles featuring a variety of modeling subjects, and accompanied by illustrations and artwork. It is not an exaggeration to say that “The Modelist” was a scholarly publication for serious modelers.</p>
	
		<p>We have also seen that SAMS began to experience problems which would be familiar to many modeling clubs. There was an established core of contributors to “The Modelist”, and for the duration of the publication of “The Modelist”, contributions were submitted by the same handful of individuals. We also have seen that leadership of the club, itself, was held by the same group of individuals through the history of the club. This cadre of leaders often invited the membership to contribute and participate, but it appears that those invitations did not achieve their goal.</p>
		
		<p>In this article, we will continue to trace the history of SAMS, and, as you have already seen in other articles about SAMS, it ends with a rather quiet shrug of the shoulders.</p>
		
		<h2>SAMS Modelist: Vol 2, No 1, Jan-Feb 1971</h2>
		
		<p>We pick up our research in January 1971 with Vol 2 Nbr 1 “1971-01-02-Jan-Feb 1971 issue. The President of SAMS was Phil Friddell and the editor of The Modelist was Greg Ripps. Contributing writers for the January issue were Bob Angel, Frank Emmett, Phil Friddell, Vance Holliday and Don Morgan. As with issues from the previous year the Editor’s column shows some exasperation with the membership for not submitting any content, and as the editor said, “not even a want or disposal advertisement? Oh, come on!”</p>
		
		<p>The content of this issue includes:</p>
			
		<ol>
			<li>The Blow Torch (a repeating column written by Frank Emmett) entitled, “Lockheed’s First Jet: The F-80 (Part II)”</li>
			<li>“Defiant” by Bob Angel </li>
			<li>“The Hawker Audax” by Don Morgan</li> 
			<li>“The Old(?!) Products Corner by Phil Friddell</li>
			<li>“The Heinkel He-51 Series” by Don Morgan</li> 
			<li>“Junk for Tanks” by Vance Holliday</li>
			<li>“The Hawker Typhoon” by Phil Friddell </li>
			<li>“The Messerschmitt Bf-109B” by Don Morgan</li> 
			<li>“Armor Review” by Vance Holliday in which he reviews a number of armor kits</li>
			<li>Lastly, the editor provided a list of articles, contained in the first six issues of “The Modelist”.</li>
		</ol>
		
	
		<p>It is important to remember that articles in “The Modelist” often ended with an impressive bibliography. Much effort was made to make “The Modelist” a professional publication and that effort is clearly visible.</p>
		
		<h2>SAMS Modelist: Vol 2, No 2, Mar-Apr 1971</h2>
		
		<p>The President of SAMS is identified in this issue as Jerry Mohr.  Greg Ripps is identified as the Editor, while Bob Angel and Phil Friddell are listed as Contributing Editors. The publication artist is James Wogstad and contributors to this issue are Vance Holliday and Don Morgan.</p>
		
		<p>This issue is of interest for a number of reasons, being that it represents a major change for SAMS. First and foremost, Phil Friddell announced that it was time for him to step away as the President of SAMS. Phil provided a little historical background in his column. He states that he served as the club Secretary for a year and then as President for two years. Since this newsletter is dated as Mar-Ap of 1971, that would indicate that Phil had served as Secretary for SAMS in its inaugural year and then as President. It is in this same column that Phil credits Frank Emmett as the Founder of SAMS. Phil also credited several other members for their positive contributions to SAMS. These members, identified by Phil, were Bob Angel, Greg Ripps, John De La Garza, Mike Salyers, as well as Mr. and Mrs. Ray Johnson, who owned Dibbles Hobby Shop.</p>
		
		<p>Phil also indicated that there were a number of reasons for what he called his “abdication”. Phil stated that, perhaps, his “individualism”, as he labeled it, was making things difficult for the club. Phil noted that his shoulder-length hair was off-putting to the military personnel with which the club interacted from time to time. (Remember, this was 1970-1971!). More significantly, Phil stated that due to his leadership role in SAMS during its early days, his fingerprint, as it were, covered the “policies and statutes” and that it was “time for a change”. </p>
		
		<p>Phil’s column was immediately followed by a column contributed by the new President, a gentleman named Jerry Mohr. Jerry’s “inaugural speech” provided some detail about his modeling background followed by a call to members to attend meetings and to volunteer their time, to get involved in club projects, and to feel free to “speak up”.</p>
		
		<p>On a personal note, one of my “Ten Commandments for Club Leaders” may have originated with Phil. That Commandment is “No Club Member shall hold an office for more than a few years.” I agree with Phil’s philosophy that a change in leadership prevents stagnation and can set the stage for club growth. Another personal connection to this issue is that, in the distant future from the “present” in which this issue of the Modelist (that “present” being 1971) some 37 years later, I was called upon by Jerry’s widow to dispose of the remaining items in his model stash. His stash filled a 10x12 storage room in a Self-Storage facility. After a few round trips and after inventorying the stash, a number of Alamo Squadron members bought some of the items, and to my knowledge, still have them. The disposal of Jerry’s modeling estate took place in the first few months of 2008 although his passing took place some years prior.</p>
		
		<p>The remainder of this issue featured the following articles: “The Do-217” by Bob Angel, “The PZL P-24” by Don Morgan, “The Airmodel Conversion Kit” by Phil Friddell, “New Kit Reviews” by Phil Friddell, “Crusader I” by Vance Holliday, “The Sopwith Pup” by Greg Ripps, “Oldies But Goodies—Reviews of Older Kits Worth Building” by Bob Angel, “The Curtiss Hawk F6C-4” by Don Morgan, “Flares and Tracers” by the Editors (A catch-all column containing general comments)</p>
		
		<h2>SAMS Modelist: Vol 2, No 3, May-Jun 1971</h2>
		
		<p>This issue was the first in which the publication title included the club name, that being abbreviated as “SAMS”. It appears that the name-change for the publication had not yet reached into all areas of the document. The cover of this issue used “The SAMS Modelist” and yet, the mast head on page 1 referred to the publication in the “traditional” verbiage, using “The Modelist. We will make short order of this issue since there is little information about SAMS within.</p> 
		
		<p>The President is Jerry Mohr, the Editor is Greg Ripps, the artist is James Wogstad and contributing editors are Bob Angel and Philip Friddell.  Contributors to this issue are Vance Holliday, Michael McMurtrey, Jerry Mohr, and Don Morgan. While McMurtrey is a new name in the list of contributors, it is noted that while Friddell had stepped away from the Presidency, he continued to make contributions to the publication. By the way, as of this writing, Mike McMurtrey has long been a resident of the Dallas area and still involved in modeling.</p>
		
		<p>A quick listing of the contents will be sufficient for this issue, and that content is: </p>
			
		<ol>
			<li>“The Ultimate in One-Up-Manship: The Rareplane” by Phil Friddell</li>
			<li>“Israeli Armor: The Six Day War (Part 1)” by Vance Holliday</li>
			<li>“The Westland Wallace, Mk. I” by Don Morgan</li>
			<li>“A Catalogue of Decals for Marking the Luftwaffe” by Jerry Mohr</li>
			<li>“An Odd Couple from Westland” by Bob Angel</li> 
			<li>“Cerro-Safe: A Tricycle Blessing” by Phil Friddell</li> 
			<li>“New Kits Review” by Phil Friddell</li> 
			<li>“The Wind Tunnel” by Mike McMurtrey</li> 
			<li>“New Armor Kits” by Vance Holliday</li>

			<li>“The Old Kits Review” by Phil Friddell</li>
		</ol>
	
		<h2>SAMS Modelist: Vol 2, No 4, Jul-Aug 1971</h2>
		
		<p>In Vol 2 Nbr 4 issue of “The SAMS Modelist”, we see some cracks in the SAMS foundation. Editor Greg Ripps offers an explanation as to the quality of the publication by stating that the grade of paper used to print the issue was not sufficient to allow printing on both sides of the paper while preventing “bleed-through” of the text. To the reader, it was, most likely, overlooked, but to Mr. Ripps, who made every effort to maintain the quality of the publication, it was a disappointment.</p>
		
		<p>In his “President’s Column”, Jerry Mohr picks up on the nature of the changes that impacted “The SAMS Modelist”. Mohr explained that the staff was unexpectedly impacted by the departure of “a few of the major contributors and staff” of the publication. No names were listed, however it was noted that the names of some regular contributors to “The Modelist” were not present in this issue. Three names stood out as missing, those being James Wogstad, who had been listed repeatedly as “Artist”, Frank Emmett, and Phil Friddell. President Mohr’s column went on to state that “a few of the major contributors and staff “had moved on to a private venture.” It should be recognized that those who have provided their time, treasure, and talent to the publication of “The Modelist” had a major role to play in making “The Modelist” a high-quality publication.  Because the names were not listed as contributors to this particular issue of “The Modelist” does not confirm that it was Wogstad and Emmett (and others) who departed for greener pastures.</p>
		
		<p>The contents of this issue are shown in the Table of Contents as:</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>“Israeli Armor: The Six-Day War (Part II)” by Vance Holliday</li> 
			<li>“The Mitsubishi 1MD1” by Don Morgan</li> 
			<li>“Random Notes with a French Accent” by Bob Angel</li>
			<li>“Flares and Tracers”- a column for random thoughts</li>
		</ol>
	
		<h2>SAMS Modelist: Vol 2, No 5 and 6, Sep-Dec 1971</h2>
		
		<p>This issue (Sept-Dec-1971) begins with what is believed to be an error. Phil Friddell, who had “abdicated” as President in the March-April issue of “The Modelist” is listed as President once again. There is no mention of President Jerry Mohr stepping down, or of an intervening election returning Friddell to office, so it is assumed that he was mistakenly listed as the President in this issue. Further, there is no “President’s Column” in this issue, by either Friddell or Mohr.</p>
		
		<p>The Editor, Greg Ripps, posted an Editor’s Column in which he submitted his resignation as Editor of “The Modelist”. In his column he included wording that indicated that he had been assured that “The Modelist” would continue to be published, and the assumption is that the regular contributors would step up to make sure the publications would continue to be printed.</p>
	
		<p>The articles in this issue are listed as:</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>“The 1/72 Bubbletop ‘Jug-Improved’” by Jim Dungan</li>
			<li>“The Stopgap Mureaux” by Bob Angel</li> 
			<li>“The Bristol Fighter” by Dan Waelti</li> 
			<li>“Some Thoughts on a P-35” by Don Morgan</li>
			<li>“IPMS Publication Survey” by Hugh R. Muir</li>
			<li>“Notes on the Barracuda” by Bob Angel</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>The Vol 2 Nbrs 5 & 6  Sept – Dec 1971 issue of “The Modelist” is the last issue that is on file in the section of the Alamo Squadron archive that stores information about SAMS. Between this issue, dated Sept-Dec 1971, and the end of SAMS as described by Bob Angel in the following paragraphs, it is assumed that either the production of “The Modelist” ended, or that no copies of the publications have been recovered for the Alamo Squadron archives.</p>
		
		<h2>The End of SAMS</h2>
	
		<p>Printed in a previous issue of [the current club newsletter] the “Navigator” Bob Angel described the end of SAMS in this manner: “By the early 70’s we had use of the NCO club for club meetings, largely due to Tom Ward’s efforts. A “Super Contest” was scheduled there in July 1974 and I was in charge of planning and trophies. When the morning arrived very few members were arriving. We had awards and judges in place and very little was happening. Finally, we had to get started, the judges were finished very quickly, and as it turned out, we had more trophies available than the total number of models! Every model got a trophy and the leftover ones were given to each judge as a token of appreciation. Well, there were some unhappy contestants and there were others who didn’t seem the least bit bothered. It seemed the club had run its course due to an overall lack of interest.” Bob Angel continues, “The final SAMS meeting was circa August 1974. The treasury (always in cash) had been nearly depleted by the lousy [turnout at the] contest. It was announced that at this final meeting the cash would be divided up evenly, and the club library (a box of books that the poor librarian had to lug to each meeting) would also be parceled out.” </p>
		
		<p>Dick Montgomery adds: “Thus was the end of SAMS. In some cases, this meeting was the last time I saw some of the SAMS members. Some of these gentlemen, I would see at Dibbles or Dick’s Hobby Shop. (Dick’s Hobby Shop was on Austin Highway in a mini-mall that was called Terrell Plaza-no relation to me.). Some would continue to meet informally and would eventually form Alamo Squadron, but that is a story for the next installment.)”</p>
		
		<p>Bob Angel became a leader in Alamo Squadron and remained active in the club until around 2001 when he retired from active participation. Bob has contributed a massive amount of documentation that forms the backbone of the SAMS and Alamo Squadron archive. Bob is a regular attendee at ModelFiesta, running a vendor table. From time to time Dick Montgomery has seen Phil Friddell, Lee Bracken, and Alan Larrumbide. Alan and Bob shared some vendor space at ModelFiesta 37/Region 6 Convention in February of 2018. It’s been a few years, but he ran into Phil and Lee Bracken at [San Antonio’s] Hill Country Hobby. These gentlemen contributed to the success of SAMS and some continued their membership in “organized modeling” in San Antonio by joining Alamo Squadron. Other SAMS members have passed away, such as Frank Garcia, and Leo Zeigler, who were there during the SAMS days and also early in the history of Alamo Squadron. It’s hard to say that some other SAMS members won’t walk through the doors at ModelFiesta in the future, and when they do, they are encouraged to let their presence be known to the Contest Registrars or the General Admission staff. It would be a great opportunity to take a few pictures and to greet them, once again, after so many years have gone by.</p>
		
		<p>This historical coverage of SAMS will end with a list of persons who were noted as “Dues Paid” members either in notes taken by Phil Friddell, or by a listing in various issues of “The Modelist”. Clearly, in the case of some notable members (names marked with as asterisk) their membership began on an earlier date, but no records, showing a specific join date, exist in the archive. The date of membership shown below is, therefore, the earliest date for which there is a written record in the archive files.</p>
