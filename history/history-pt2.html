		<p>By Dick Montgomery, IPMS/USA# 14003</p>
		
		<p>The previous installment in the “History of Alamo Squadron” covered a number of stories and articles in the San Antonio Modelers Society publication known as “The Modelist”. The time frame covered was from November of 1969 thru April of 1970. This article begins in May/June of 1970 and will trace the content of the Modelist through the end of that year. </p>
		
		<p>It is important to remember that “The Modelist” was not, in fact, the club newsletter for the San Antonio Modeler’s Society, but was a stand-alone publication. The articles featured a scholarly approach to their subject, complete with documentation and original art-work. The internal issues that most clubs experience were sometimes alluded to, but not covered in depth in “The Modelist”. One can get a sense of these issues through editorial comments in “The Modelist”, but, at best, we get only a sketch and not a portrait. </p>
		
		<h2>SAMS Modelist: Vol 1, No 4, May-Jun 1970</h2>
		
		<p>That having been said, the May-June 1970 issue, Volume I, Number 4, begins with a message from the club President, Phil Friddell. In this column, Phil expressed his appreciation for the “vote of confidence” that, apparently, returned the existing officers to a repeat term. In his column, Phil invited members to take no-tice of the “Wants and Disposals” column in “The Modelist”. Gregg Ripps continued his role as the editor of the publication, and he apologized for the failure of “The Modelist” to meet its deadline for publication. More interesting is the explanation provided by the editor regarding some artwork in the newsletter that includes a rendition of some P-47 nose art that features a nude female figure. The editor points out that, as Ripps said, “it is the policy of “The Modelist”…., to publish any material of reasonable quality and of reasonable interest to plastic modelers.” Ripps concluded by stating that, “in as much as “The Modelist” is a club publication, it is primarily the responsibility of the members to judge the material they submit.”</p> 
		
		<p>The first article in this edition features the Nakajima Type 90 Fighter, written by Don Morgan, accompanied by some artwork by Jim Wogstad, who is credit-ed in the newsletter as the “Artist” for “The Modelist”. Morgan’s article is interesting because it is based on the use of a fuselage from a P6E and an F4B-4 wing. Of course, with the passage of some time, modelers do not need to convert or scratch-build a Type 90. The Fine Molds Type 90 will fill the bill. An article by Bob Angel was included in this issue, and the article title was almost the same length as the article itself. In his article “Daddy, Did You See Any Red Messerschmitts In the War” or “A Languid Look at the Polystyrene Past”, Bob shared some memories of kits long gone. Bob speaks of some rather colorful kits, molded in yellow or red, as well as other kits which provided raised lines showing the location at which national markings and aircraft ID numbers were to be placed. On a personal level, I remember con-structing kits that were very colorful, and as my interest and “skill” level increased, moved to 1/48th Monogram kits, a scale which, to this day, I prefer over any other. But these colorful kits were served as the “gateway” kit for many a young modeler. </p>
		
		<p>Greg Ripps provided part III of his series, “The Effect of the Airplane On World War I”. This article con-cludes with the acknowledgment that control of the air was, at the end of World War I, a contributing factor in the victory of the Allied forces. An interesting feature of this article is the bibliography used as “source material”. The most recent source provided was a publication from 1966 and was a publication authored by Billy Mitchell. </p>
		
		<p>There are other articles in this issue, and just to be inclusive a list is presented here:</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>"Weathering Techniques For Model Aircraft" by Al Orvedahl. </li>
			<li>"Eleventh-Hour Peggy, Japan’s Best Medium" by Bob Angel </li>
			<li>"A Review: The Monogram Pz.KPFW. IV/H and Flakpanzer IV, 2cm Whirlwind" by Vance Holiday</li> 
			<li>Other features include a Membership application form for IPMS. (Note that SAMS took great pains to show that the club was affiliated with IPMS and was a great supporter of IPMS)</li>
			<li>SAMS Trading Post: with a short list of items wanted by various members, and an advertisement listing Dibbles Hobby Shop as the “Best in the South” with an acknowledgement that Dibbles was a strong supporter of IPMS. </li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>True to form, established in earlier months in SAMS history, both Friddell and Ripps show leadership by encouraging the membership to step forward, to offer contributions to “The Modeler”. And there is a group of members who answer that call by submitting articles and artwork to “The Modeler”.</p>
		
		<h2>SAMS Modelist: Vol 1, No 5, Jul-Aug 1970</h2>
		
		<p>The July-August, 1970 version of “The Modelist” follows the same format as previous editions. The first page featured a President’s Column and an Editorial statement. The President’s column reveals a problem that many clubs face. Meetings, and the club, can be dominated by a person, or small core of persons, or, on the other end of the spectrum, it could be that the vast majority of the club membership is very content to depend upon one or a small group to lead the club, and do not offer input on business issues or on pro-gram content during the meeting. In some cases, the club leadership does not wish to share meeting time with anyone, and the club and meeting time are used for self-gratification. In some cases, the membership does not feel comfortable in sharing their work, or ex-pressing their opinion, having seen others treated poorly by the leadership. In the case of SAMS, the President invited and encouraged the “silent member-ship” to step forward, and the invitation was genuine. A good leader knows that clubs become stronger when the membership is positively involved in club activities. It becomes clear, when one considers the current atmosphere in Alamo Squadron, in which club members are encouraged to participate in several ways. The Model Summit Program, the Bachelor Build Night, the emphasis on demonstrations presented by members, the encouragement to make contributions to the Navigator, and, of course, the annual request for members to take staff positions at ModelFiesta along with the open invitation to all members to attend Model-Fiesta Staff meetings are all signs of a healthy club. </p>
		
		<p>It is significant that the Editor’s comments in this is-sue of “The Modelist” also invite and encourage members to contributions to “The Modelist”. The editor states that he can “edit” the contributions, and, after all, that’s his job. </p>
		
		<p>The bulk of this issue contains the type of useful article that the editor was calling for, and even with to-day’s higher quality of available kits, the content is still interesting and useful. </p>
		
		<p>The remainder of this “Modelist” is given over to: </p>
	
		<ol>
			<li>"The Republic F-84" by Don Morgan </li>
			<li>"The Douglas Dauntless" by Bob Angel</li> 
			<li>"Showcase and Review" by Mike Salyers – In this article the author addresses an incident in the club’s “Super Contest”. Salyers states that a contestant challenged the judging ability of one of the judges. The contestant in question was chastised for doing so, apparently it was a rather confrontational discussion between the judge and the contestant. </li>
			<li>Two paragraphs about local hobby shops, one for Dibbles Hobbies and another for “Hobbyland” which was located on McCullough Ave. </li>
			<li>A kit review of the Airfix C-130K, author not identified </li>
			<li>A review of the Monogram Pz.Kpfw. IV/H in Vance Holliday repeating column named, “The Armory” </li>
			<li>"The Ju-87 Stuka" by Phil Friddell </li>
			<li>"The Frog [Models] Ju-87G" by Frank Emmett</li> 
			<li>"Simulating Aluminum Aircraft Finishes" by Bob Angel</li> 
			<li>"Converting Monogram’s B-52 to the Curtiss Wright CW-21B" by Jack Keefe </li>
			<li>"The Modeler and the Club: A Critical Analysis" by Greg Ripps </li>
		</ol>
	
		<p>This last article is consistent with the content of Ripps’ “Editor’s Column” and President Friddell’s column. One of the suggestions that Ripps makes in this article is that members should be allowed to “review” their model before other members are called upon or invited to do so. It’s interesting to think about one of the standard items on the agenda at Alamo Squadron meetings in which members who bring models for display do just this thing. Its called the W.I.P., or Work in Progress, and members are invited to take a minute to describe their challenges, failure and successes they are experiencing with a model that is under construction. I think Ripps would be pleased with the W.I.P. program.</p>
		
		<h2>SAMS Modelist: Vol 1, No 6, Sep-Oct 1970</h2>
		
		<p>The September-October issue of “The Modelist” lists the President as Phil Friddell, the Editor as Gregory Ripps and contributors as Robert “Bob” Angel, Frank Emmett, Phil Friddell, Vance Holliday, and Don Morgan. This is notable in that these individuals appear as Officers, Staff, or Contributors in every “The Modelist” that is in the archive. It appears that, as elected officials, and as contributors, these gents put forward an effort requiring time, talent, and treasure. And, as we have seen in previous editions, the general membership was encouraged to join them by contributing material for “The Modelist”. It appears that, up to this time, few members heeded the call. </p>
		
		<p>Again, the signs of a club which is beginning to face some serious issues, are present. Calls for the membership to participate in club activities seems to be going unheeded. For us, back in the Present, there are a number of lessons to be drawn, and two of those lessons stand out. First, consider the “why” that motivates people to join a modeling club, and secondly, consider whether the club is offering those activities that would interest those members, or prospective members. There are other significant issues as well, but for now, we see a club that is travelling through a troubled patch.</p> 
		
		<p>In the next installment, we will see the end of SAMS, but the seeds of Alamo Squadron will be sown as well.</p>
