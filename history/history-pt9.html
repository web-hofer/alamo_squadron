		By 1995 Alamo Squadron had matured steadily, and much like a teenager entering his late teen years had gone through growth pains and personality clashes, with some poor choices being overcome by good leadership coupled with club members who had dedicated time, treasure, and talent to the club.
		</p> 

		<p>
		Newsletters from 1995 show the club being involved in some interesting activities. The May/June issue of “Alamo Squadron News” contained a report by President Phil Sanders that Alamo Squadron had participated in the Air Show at Randolph Air Force Base. Over the years Alamo Squadron too advantage of the opportunities presented by participating at Air Shows. It was an excellent way to publicize the club and to recruit new members. In the case of this particular Air Show, 4 new members were recruited.
		</p>

		<p>
		The newsletter also indicates that the club, once again, changed its meeting location. This change saw the club moving to the Northeast Police Station on Jones-Maltsberger Road. A club roster was included in the newsletter and a quick scan of the page shows that a number of current members were present in 1995. Those members being:
		</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Bob Angel- a current Life Member</li>
				<li>Lee Forbes- a current Life Member</li>
				<li>Dick Montgomery – a current Life Member</li>
				<li>Charlie Moriarty – a current Life Member</li>
				<li>Bob Carr, often serving as an officer and as Vendor Coordinator in numerous ModelFiestas</li>
				<li>David Walker, a long-time member and supporter of Alamo Squadron</li>
			</ul>

		<p>
		By July of 1995 the club had, once again, relocated. Meetings were now being held at the Brook Hollow Library Branch on Heimer Road. This relocation was followed by yet another change in meeting location. In October the club moved to the AMF Country Lanes Bowling Alley located on San Pedro Avenue on the south-bound side of Highway 281. By coincidence, the current meeting location (as of 2018) is just on the other side of Highway 281, that being Northside Ford car dealership.
		</p>

		<p>
		During the middle months of 1995, a number of members decided to publish a modeling magazine much like the AIM magazine mentioned in earlier articles in this series. The magazine was, most certainly, a product published by club members, but was designed to be about the hobby and not about the club. The Oct 1995, Vol 1 & 2, featured a list of articles that included a number of subjects. An article about he 1995 IPMS National Convention in Albuquerque was included, as reviews and kit announcements featuring ProModeler’s P-40E, Sub kits by Karo, a Tamiya M4 Sherman, and a Hasegawa MC.202, to name a few.
		</p>

		<p>
		In the November issue of the club newsletter, the newly elected President, Bob Carr, addressed the withdrawal from the club of some long-time members, including some Founding Members. The reason for their departure from Alamo Squadron was that the club had moved away from their early vision of a club that focused on aircraft modeling. And, indeed, the club had broadened the range of interests of members. Bob, himself, was and still is, a NASCAR aficionado, and several members were interested in ships, armor, Sci Fi, and spacecraft. The schism was not characterized by ill will or lack of respect but motivated more by a feeling of disenfranchisement on the part of those members who were Aircraft fans, first and only. Today, Alamo Squadron has a membership that is quite diverse in interest and favorite modeling subject. In fact, just look at the October 2018 issue. The two featured articles are armor and Sci Fi Space related, not an aircraft in sight! And here I sit, next to my modeling workbench which is currently occupied by…………you guessed it, an airplane. I’m far into my Wingnut Wings Pfalz XII project and loving it! It is not that the departing Aircraft Modelers simply turned their backs on the club and walked away……not even close. To this day (2018) a number of those individuals continue to attend ModelFiesta. In doing so, these individuals continue to support Alamo Squadron and enjoy the hobby.
		</p>

		<p>
		Throughout the remaining years in the 1990s, Alamo Squadron continued to provide a community space for those interested in modeling. Some activities in the newsletters for the late 1990’s focus on the club, and other articles clearly show that the club was very much aware of a larger community of modelers. Some notable events and activities include:
		</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Aug, 1997 – Tom Ward was awarded the first “Alamo Squadron IPMS/USA Founders Award”. Tom was not only present at the birth of Alamo Squadron but was one of those members 
				who guided the new club and made significant contributions to the character and personality of the club as it currently exists.</li>
				<li>Aug, 1997 – Lee Forbes had attended the 1997 IPMS National Convention and shared his experiences with the club members.</li>
				<li>Jan, 1998 – Bob Carr writes an editorial in the club newsletter regarding IPMS and membership guidelines for local clubs when renewing the club charter with IPMS</li>
				<li>June, 1998 – Announcement that Tom Ward’s widow will attend a future meeting and bring in some of Tom’s stash for liquidation.</li>
				<li>June, 1998 – Bob Angel submits an article titled, “Organized Plastic Modeling in San Antonio…an informal history.”</li>
			</ul>

		A look at the officers who served for the years 1995 to 2000:

		Don Cook was elected as President, but a relocation to Albuquerque resulted in a need to fill that office. Gordon Zeigler moved from Vice President to President, and Lee Forbes assumed the role of Vice President as well as his elected role as Sec/Treasurer. The club constitution (as it now exists in 2019) would not allow one member to hold more than one E-Board office at any time. The club could very well be put into a difficult position were that person to relocate.
		</p>

		<p>
		1998-1999 saw Alamo Squadron reach a notable milestone. Alamo Squadron, an IPMS Chapter from its inception in November, 1977, was one of several chapters that had self-nominated for the prestigious IPMS/USA Chapter of the Year award. Lee Forbes assembled the information for the nomination documentation and was on hand at the IPMS convention to receive the award on behalf of Alamo Squadron. Officers at the time were Lee Forbes (President), Bob Smith (Vice President), and Bob Carr (Sec/Treasurer).
