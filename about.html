		Our main goal as an organization is to help scale modelers improve their modeling skills. We accomplish this through monthly meetings filled with learning programs, an
		annual scale modeling show and contest known as ModelFiesta, the publishing of a monthly newsletter featuring club members' builds and techniques, a biannual, multi-week instructional class called the Adult Build Course, and informal get-togethers of club members to work on scale models in a group environment promoting the sharing of skills and techniques. While we have some very highly skilled builders in our ranks we are NOT a clique of "master modelers" that maintains a high-bar required for membership. In fact, we have no bar at all and encourage scale modelers of all ages and skill levels to join our ranks as well as becoming a member of our national organization, IPMS/USA. The focus of Alamo Squadron is teaching and learning.
		</p>

		<p>
		The club meets once a month for formal meetings as well as an additional day (usually on a weekend) dedicated to just building models in a group environment. Check out our Meetings page for additional details on our meetings. They are always open to the public and encourage you to join us.
		</p>

		<p>
		Alamo Squadron was first chartered as an IPMS/USA club in 1977. Visit our <i><b>History</b></i> page to learn more about our rich history in the San Antonio area 
		as well as our current Constitution and Bylaws.
