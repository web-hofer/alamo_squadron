	<p><b><i>DO YOU WANT TO LEARN HOW TO BUILD PLASTIC MODELS, OR GET BACK INTO THE HOBBY?</i></b></p>
 
	<p>If the answer is yes, Alamo Squadron of San Antonio, TX hosts an Adult Build Course (ABC) twice a year (one in the Spring and the other in the Fall), to teach the basics of building plastic models. Members of Alamo Squadron who are experienced model builders are the instructors. The course is a "Hands On/How To" class designed for adults of all ages and is conducted over the course of six to eight sessions which usually meet on Saturdays, however time and dates may vary depending on the availabilty of the volunteer instructors.</p>
 
	<p>The Course uses an inexpensive scale model kit to illustrate the basic tools and techniques of successfully building a plastic model. A course Handbook is made available to students which lists the materials needed and describes the modeling curriculum.  Students must join Alamo Squadron in order to participate in the ABC, with the annual membership dues being $24.00. Class sizes are generally limited to six students.</p>
