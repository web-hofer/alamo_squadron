	<h1>Build Days</h1>
	<p>Once a month Alamo Squadron utilizes HobbyTown USA of San Antonio's community room to meet and build models. These meetings are much less formal and consist of members getting together, working on their latest build, and discussing or sharing techniques they utilize in their build process. The club usually has an airbrush and compressor set-up during these meetings to help teach those less familiar with this essential tool. These lessons are informal and more of a familiarization of this tool.</p>
