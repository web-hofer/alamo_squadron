	<h1>Works in Progress</h1>
	<p>At each monthly meeting Alamo Squadron invites members to bring the current kit (or kits) they are working and give a couple-minute run-down the kit(s) and the progress they have made so far. We encourage members to tell the rest of the club the positives and negatives of the build as well as how they overcame the negatives. This is an extremely effective way to spur discussion on differing kits, tools, and supplies on the market today as
	well as the techniques utilized to apply them.
